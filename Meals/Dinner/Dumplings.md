#### Instructions
Prepare Your Workstation:
1. Get your dumpling wrappers ready. If they were frozen, make sure they’re fully thawed. Have a small bowl of water nearby for sealing, and a tray lined with baking paper ready to place your finished dumplings.
2. Make sure to keep the dumpling wrappers under a clean, damp cloth so they don’t dry out. Once they dry out, they’re almost impossible to seal!
To Assemble the Dumplings: 
3. Take one dumpling wrapper, dip your finger in the small bowl of water, and moisten the edge of half the dumpling wrapper in a semi-circle. 
4. Place about 1 tsp of filling (don’t overfill!) slightly off-centre on the wrapper. The exact amount of filling will depend on the size of your wrappers.
5. Fold the wrapper in half to create a half-moon shape, enclosing the filling.
6. Starting from one end, pinch and pleat the edges together to seal the dumpling securely. There are many pleating styles, the key is to ensure it’s tightly sealed so the filling doesn’t escape during cooking.
7. Place the finished dumpling on your prepared tray, ensuring they don’t touch each other too much. Repeat with the remaining filling and wrappers.
8. At this point, if you aren’t going to cook them immediately, you can place the dumplings in the freezer. Once frozen, you don’t need to defrost before cooking, they can just go straight into the pan.
Cook the Dumplings (Pan-Frying Method):
9. Heat the neutral oil in a large non-stick frying pan over medium-high heat. While waiting for the pan to heat up, boil some water in a kettle.
10. Carefully arrange a single layer of dumplings in the pan, leaving a little space between each. Don’t overcrowd the pan; cook in batches if necessary.
11. Carefully pour the water into the pan. You want the water to come about half-way up the sides of the dumplings. Immediately cover the pan with a lid.
12. Reduce the heat a little, and cook the dumplings for about 7-8 minutes, or until the pork filling is cooked through and the wrappers are translucent and tender. The liquid should have mostly evaporated.
13. Remove the lid and allow any remaining water to evaporate. You can continue to cook the dumplings until the bottoms have crisped up to your preferred crisp level.
14. Serve the hot dumplings immediately with your favourite dipping sauce

#### Notes:
- To freeze the dumplings, make sure they are in a single layer and not touching. Once frozen, you can transfer the dumplings to an airtight container or bag. They will store in the freezer for up to 3 months.
