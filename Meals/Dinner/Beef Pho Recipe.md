Pho recipe Ingredients Broth - 3 pounds of beef bones 2 pound of ox tail 1 pound beef brisket 4 inch ginger 2 yellow onions

Spices for broth 5 star anise 1 tsp fennel seeds 1 tablespoon of coriander 2 cinnamon sticks 10 cloves 3 cardamom pods

24 cups of water 1 tablespoon salt for broth 1-2 tablespoon of sugar 5-6 tablespoons salt for cleaning beef 1 tablespoon of fish sauce

2 14oz bags of fresh or dry rice noodles (Soak rice noodles for 1 hour before your ready to serve)

Toppings - 1 pound of beef Short rib or New York steak or eye round 1 bunch cilantro 1 bunch basil 1 jalapeno 1 yellow onion 1 bunch green onion Bean sprouts Lime slices Hoisin sauce Sriracha

Transfer half of the beef bones into a large bowl and sprinkle with 1 Tbsp salt. Add the remaining bones and oxtail and sprinkle with another 1 Tbsp salt. Using your fingers, gently rub the salt onto the bones and oxtail. Under cold running water, wash each piece thoroughly and transfer into large stock pot. Fill with water and 1 tablesoon salt and bring to a boil, let it boil for 7 minutes. Turn off heat and discard the water into the sink, transfer all pieces of meat into colander and rinse with cool water. Wash the stock pot to remove any dirty beef bits.

Take the beef brisket and sprinkle with 1-2 tablespoon of salt and rub around the beef to clean it, then rinse with cool water. Now lay the brisket over the bones and ox tail in the pot, put the remaining half of the bones and ox tail to lay on top the brisket. This keeps the brisket from floating to the top. Now fill the pot with water until all beef is covered by 1 inch water.

Take the two onions and peel first layer. Cut onions in half. Char the onions and ginger over low the gas burner or on low broil in oven until you see some char marks, flip ginger and onion when one side is charred enough. Peel off charred layers of onion and discard, peel off ginger skin and discard. Slice ginger lengthwise. Add ginger and onion into stock pot with the beef bones and brisket. The water should still sit about 1 inch above the beef bones. Add 1 tablespoon of salt and 1 tablespoon of sugar. You can add more of both later, depends on your preference. Turn on stove to medium heat, once it boils turn to low. Cover stock pot leaving a little gap. Let stock simmer for 3-4 hours, the stock shouldn’t boil at all, if it does, turn off the stove and wait 30 min before turning on back to low. Every 30-45 min skim off the floating foam and bits on top do the stock. After 3-4 hours, let stock rest for 1-1.5 hour. Turn on stove again to low, and cook again for 1 hour. After 1 hour, let stock rest for another hour. At this point the brisket and ox tail should be tender enough to take out, if not you can continue to cook and monitor when the texture is right for you.

Now start toasting the spices. Place all spices on cookie sheet and toast on low broil in oven for 1-2 min, careful as oven temps vary and can burn quickly. Or you can toast spices on a pan over the stove, toast on low heat for 7 min. Spices should be fragrant.

After stock has rested for 1 hour, add spices into spice bag or tea bag to prevent from getting lost in the stock, you can leave out the cinnamon sticks and whole star anise since they’re bigger. Add spices to the stock. Turn on the stove to low and cook for 2 hours. Turn off the stock and let rest for 1-2 hours.

Place stock that you are about to eat into separate pot, for every 8 cups of broth use 1 tablespoon of fish sauce into broth. Don’t add into entire broth as it can make it sour in the fridge. Feel free to add more salt and sugar S needed.
