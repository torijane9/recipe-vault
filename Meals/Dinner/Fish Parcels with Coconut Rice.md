2. Combine garlic, ginger, fish sauce, sesame oil, and chilli in a small bowl. Brush/spoon over each of the fish fillets, then sprinkle spring onion over top. Season with salt and pepper.
3. Fold the paper in half over the fish and twist the edges of the paper together to each each parcel. Place the parcels side by side on an oven tray and bake for 6-8 minutes or until the fish is just cooked. 
4. Open the parcels at the table and serve with coriander leaves, lime wedges, and coconut rice.
