### Fish Sauce Caramel Brussels Sprouts 

### Ingredients
#ingredients 
- [ ] 1 small shallot
- [ ] 500g Brussels sprouts
- [ ] 2 Tbsp canola oil, divided
- [ ] 1/4 cup packed brown sugar
- [ ] 1/4 cup water
- [ ] 1 Tbsp fish sauce
- [ ] 2 tsp toasted sesame seeds

#### Instructions
1. Finely chop 1 small shallot (2 tablespoons to 1/4 cup). Trim and halve the Brussels sprouts, saving any leaves that fall off (about 4 cups).
2. Heat 1 tablespoon of the canola oil over medium heat in a 10-inch skillet until shimmering. Add half of the Brussels sprouts and leaves and toss to coat in the oil. Arrange the Brussels sprouts in a single layer cut-side down. Cook undisturbed until the Brussels sprouts are crisp-tender and the bottoms are deeply browned, 5 to 8 minutes. Transfer to a plate and repeat with the remaining 1 tablespoon canola oil and Brussels sprouts. Transfer to the same plate.
3. Add the shallots, 1/4 cup packed light brown sugar, 1/4 cup water, and 1 tablespoon fish sauce to the skillet. Cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened, 3 to 4 minutes. Return the Brussels to the pan and toss to coat.
4. Remove the pan from the heat. Let cool for 5 minutes since the caramel is very hot before serving. Garnish with 2 teaspoons toasted white sesame seeds.
