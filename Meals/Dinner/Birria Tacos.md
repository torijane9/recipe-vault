### Instructions
Prepare the Components:
1. Carefully remove all the braised birria meat from the liquid. The meat should be incredibly tender and fall apart easily. Using two forks, shred all the meat. Keep warm.
2. Ladle the birria braising liquid (consommé) into a separate pot or bowl. If you’d like, you can skim off some of the excess fat from the surface. Heat the consommé gently over a low heat or keep it warm in the bowl until ready to serve.
3. In separate bowls, have the finely diced onion, chopped fresh coriander, lime wedges, and grated cheese ready.
Assemble The Tacos:
4. Heat a large flat griddle or heavy-bottomed frying pan over a medium-high heat.
5. Take one corn tortilla and dip into the warm birria consommé, ensuring both sides are coated.
6. Place the dipped tortilla onto the hot griddle or frying pan.
7. Immediately, add a generous spoonful of the shredded birria meat to one half of the tortilla, then sprinkle a good amount of grated cheese over the meat.
8. Once the tortilla begins to crisp up and the cheese starts to melt (this happens quickly), use a spatula to fold the empty half of the tortilla over the filling.
9. Press down gently with the spatula and cook for another 1-2 minutes per side, or until the tortilla is golden brown and crispy, and the cheese is fully melted and gooey. You can add a tiny drizzle of extra oil to the griddle if needed for crisping, but the fat from the consommé often suffices.
10. Repeat and continue until all of the meat and tortillas have been used, and transfer finished tacos to a serving platter.
11. Serve the hot birria tacos immediately with small bowls of the warm birria consommé for dipping, and a generous side of the diced white onion, chopped coriander, and lime wedges for each person.
#### Notes
- You can use two corn tortillas per taco if you’d like. This prevents them from tearing under the weight of the meat and cheese.
- Don’t overfill the tacos! White tempting, overfilling can make it hard to fold, and can cause the tacos to burst.
- Have a low oven ready to keep batches of tacos warm while you’re cooking others, if you want to serve everyone at once.
