#### Instructions
1. If your rotisserie chicken is cold, feel free to warm it up in a steamer or in the microwave. Carefully remove the skin and shred the meat, then add it to a bowl.
2. Add fresh herbs and tomatoes - you can coarsely tear the mint and basil as you add it if you’d like, and gently toss to combine.
3. Add half the ginger shallot oil and half the fish sauce mixtures and toss to combine. Taste the salad and add additional oil or fish sauce to taste. 
4. Serve immediately alongside hot coconut rice

#### Notes:
- The salad is best eaten day-of but can be kept in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 2 days.
