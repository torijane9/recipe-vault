### Instructions
1. In a medium-sized bowl, combine the bulgur and boiling water. Cover with lid, and let stand for 25 minutes, until the bulgur is cooked al dente. 
2. Drain through a dine-mesh strainer to remove any excess water.
3. Trim and thinly slice the brussels sprouts (or shred using the shredding disk of a food processor), toss in the olive oil, and roast for 5-10 minutes, until the brussels sprouts are (?????)
4. In a large bowl, add the brussels sprouts, dressing, cooked bulgur wheat, spring onions, mint, and pomegranate seeds, and toss to combine. 
5. Taste and season, adding salt and pepper, and more lemon juice or olive oil as needed. Stir in the pistachios just before serving.
#### Notes
- This salad can be made up a day ahead of time (except for the pistachios) and refrigerated in an airtight container. Bring to room temperature, and add the pistachios right before serving.
