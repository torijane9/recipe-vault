#### Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 180°C, and grease a 7” x 11” baking pan.
2. In a heat-proof measuring jug, add the boiling water and dissolve the instant coffee powder. Once dissolved, whisk the cocoa powder into the hot coffee until smooth. Set aside to cool.
3. In a bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder, and salt.
4. In a larger mixing bowl, combine melted butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar. Mix in eggs, one at a time, then mix in the vanilla and the cooled coffee/chocolate mixture.
5. Add dry mixture alternating with the sour cream (dry → sour cream → dry → sour cream → dry).
6. Spread batter into prepared pan. Tap pan firmly on counter top several times to force out large air bubbles.
7. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the centre comes out clean, approx. 20-25 minutes. Don’t overbake!
8. Let the cake cool. Once cooled, pour the chocolate fudge frosting over the cake. 
9. Put the cake in the fridge to chill and set the frosting - at least a couple of hours, or overnight. 
10. Serve cold, and store in the fridge.
