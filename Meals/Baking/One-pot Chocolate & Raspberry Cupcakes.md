#### Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 180°C. Line 24 muffin pan with paper cases. 
2. Place butter, oil, water, and chocolate in a medium-large pot and melt over medium heat. 
3. Turn off heat and whisk in cocoa and caster sugar, making sure there are no lumps of cocoa. Then whisk in eggs and vanilla extract.
4. Mix baking powder and baking soda into yoghurt or sour cream, then add to the chocolate mixture with the flour, whisking until evenly combined into a smooth batter. Stand for at least 10 minutes before cooking.
5. Spoon mixture into paper cases, using about 3 Tbsp per cupcake to 3/4 fill each case. 
6. Push 2-3 raspberries into each one (if berries are frozen, stand cupcakes a further 10 minutes before cooking).
7. Bake cupcakes until they are risen and the tops bounce back when gently pressed, about 20 minutes. Stand for 5 minutes before taking cupcakes out of the tin.
8. Once cooled, ice with the [[Blackcurrant Frosting]]
