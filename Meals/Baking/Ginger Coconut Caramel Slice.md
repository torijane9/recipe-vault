#### Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 180°C. Grease and line a square baking tin (approx. 20cm x 20cm) with baking paper, ensuring the paper hangs over the sides for easy removal.
2. **Cookie Base**: In a large bowl, cream together the softened butter, brown sugar, and golden syrup until light and fluffy. Beat in the egg until well combined. 
3. In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, ground ginger, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.
4. Press the base dough evenly into the prepared baking tin.
5. Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the base is golden brown and slightly firm to the touch. 
6. Once cooked, remove the base from the oven and let it cool slightly for about 10 minutes. Then, spread the jar of coconut caramel sauce evenly over the warm base. 
7. Sprinkle the shredded coconut evenly over the caramel layer, and place the slice back in the oven.
8. Bake for an additional 5-7 minutes, keeping a close eye on it to ensure the coconut doesn’t burn. You’re aiming for a lovely golden-brown colour and gently bubbling caramel.
9. Remove from the oven and let it cool completely before placing it in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours to set.
10. Once set, lift the slice out of the tin using the overhanging baking paper. Cut into squares and serve.

#### Notes:
- If you want to add more ginger flavour, you can chop up some crystalised ginger and combine it with the shredded coconut before sprinkling both on top of the caramel.
