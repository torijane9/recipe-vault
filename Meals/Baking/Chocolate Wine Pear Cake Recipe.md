\- One 9-inch tart; Serves up to 10 -
Prebaked and cooled [tart shell](http://playingwithflour.blogspot.com/2011/08/easiest-tart-shell.html%20/l%20more)
10 ounces bittersweet or semisweet chocolate, chopped
1 cup half-and-half (or heavy cream)
1 large egg
1 large egg yolk
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
Placed chopped chocolate and half-and-half into a large heatproof bowl.  Set the bowl over a pan of simmering water and heat the mixture, stirring occasionally, until the chocolate is fully melted and smooth. 
Remove the bowl from the pan and stir for a minute or two to cool slightly.  Whisk in egg, egg yolk, and vanilla extract.  Set the prebaked tart pan onto a baking sheet and pour the mixture evenly into it.
Bake the tart until the filling is set but still quivers a bit when moved gently, about 20 minutes.  Don't overbake. 
Remove the tart from the oven and cool completely before removing the ring of the tart pan.  The tart is best served the day it is made.  I highly recommend vanilla ice cream (or your preferred flavor) as accompaniment though you could also consider a dallop of whipped cream.
**Makes 1 cake, to serve 16 to 20.** 

### Ingredients

**Cake:**

* **18 Tbsp. unsalted butter at room temperature, plus more for greasing**
* **2 1/4 cups packed dark brown sugar**
* **3/4 cup granulated sugar**
* **4 large eggs, at room temperature**
* **1 large egg yolk**
* **2 1/4 cups red wine**
* **1 Tbsp. vanilla extract**
* **3 cups plus 2 Tbsp. all-purpose flour**
* **1 1/2 cups Dutch-process cocoa powder**
* **3/8 tsp. baking soda**
* **1 1/2 tsp. baking powder**
* **3/4 tsp. ground cinnamon**
* **3/4 tsp. salt**

**Frosting:**

* **24 ounces cream cheese (three 8-ounce boxes), at room temperature**
* **3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) butter, at room temperature**
* **2 tsp. vanilla extract**
* **3 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar**

Directions
_**Active time: 30 minutes**_ 
_**Total time: 1 hour**_ 

**To make cake:** **Preheat oven to 325°. Line the bottom of three 9 round cake pans with parchment paper. Grease parchment and sides of pan. Place butter in a large bowl. Using an electric mixer, cream butter on medium speed until smooth. Add brown and granulated sugars and beat until fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add eggs and yolk and beat until incorporated, then add red wine and vanilla. (Don't worry if the batter looks a little uneven and grainy.)** 

**In a medium bowl, mix flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt. Sift dry mixture over wet ingredients. Mix until 3/4 combined, then fold in remaining dry mixture with a rubber spatula.** 

**Divide batter among prepared pans. Bake 25 to 30 minutes, or until a cake tester inserted into the center of each layer comes out clean. The top of each cake should be shiny and smooth. Cool in the pan 10 minutes, then remove cakes from pans and let cool completely on a rack. (If cakes have domed a bit and you want even layers, trim tops using a long serrated knife held horizontally.)** 

**To make frosting:** **In a medium bowl, use an electric mixer to beat cream cheese and butter until smooth. Mix in vanilla, then gradually stir in confectioners' sugar.** 

**To frost cake, place one layer on a cake stand or plate and spread with 1 cup frosting. Repeat with next 2 layers and spread top and sides with remaining frosting.**

Makes a 9×5″ loaf

1/2 cup (1 stick or 4 ounces) unsalted butter, softened
1 cup (6 7/8 ounces) firmly packed light brown sugar
1/2 cup (4 ounces) granulated sugar
1 large egg, at room temperature
3/4 cup red wine
1/4 cup plain yogurt
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 cups (6 3/4 ounces) all-purpose flour
3/4 cup (2 5/8 ounces) Dutch cocoa powder (see above for a natural cocoa adjustment)
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
Preheat the oven to 325 F. Butter and flour a 9×5″ loaf pan.
Beat the butter on medium speed with an electric mixer until smooth. Add the sugars and cream until lightened and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Beat in the egg until well combined, then mix in the wine, yogurt, and vanilla. The batter might look curdled, but don’t worry. Sift in the flour, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Stir with a spoon until there are no streaks of flour left, scraping down the sides of the bowl and being careful not to over mix.
Scrape the batter into the loaf pan and bake 60-70 minutes, or until a thin knife inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean. Cool the loaf in the pan on a rack for 10-15 minutes, then run a knife around the edges and turn it out.
