#### Instructions
**Prepare the Almond Syrup:**
1. In a small saucepan, combine the caster sugar and water. Heat gently over a medium heat, stirring until the sugar has completely dissolved.
2. Bring to a brief simmer, then remove from the heat. Stir in the almond or vanilla extract. Let the syrup cool slightly while you assemble the scrolls.
Assemble the Scrolls:
3. Take the thoroughly chilled [[Laminated Dough]] from the fridge. On a lightly floured surface, gently roll the dough into a large rectangle, approximately 40cm x 30cm and about 3-4mm thick. Try to keep the edges as straight as possible.
4. Evenly spread the [[Frangipane Filling]] over the entire surface of the dough rectangle, leaving a small 1-2cm border along one of the longer edges to help with sealing.
5. Starting from the long edge opposite the border you left, tightly roll the dough into a neat log. Try to keep the roll as even as possible to ensure uniform scrolls.
6. Once rolled, lightly dampen the un-filled border edge with a little water, and press it firmly against the log to seal the seam. This is to prevent the scrolls from unravelling during baking.
7. **Optional**: For easier and cleaner cutting, you can wrap the log lightly in glad wrap and chill it in the fridge for 15-30 minutes. This firms up the butter and frangipane.
8. Using a very sharp knife, carefully slice the log into 12 even scrolls, about 3-3.5cm thick.
9. Line a large baking tray with baking paper. Place the sliced scrolls cut-side up onto the prepared tray, leaving at least 3-4cm of space between each scroll, as they will expand while proofing.
Proofing:
10. Loosely cover the scrolls with glad wrap (or a clean tea towel).
11. Place the tray in a warm place to proof for 1.5-2.5 hours, or until visibly puffy and almost doubled in size. They should feel light and airy. The exact amount of proofing time will depend on your room temperature. Be patient here and don’t rush it.
Bake:
12. Closer to the end of the proofing time, preheat your oven to 190°C.
13. Just before baking, gently sprinkle the flaked almonds over the top of each scroll.
14. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the scrolls are deeply golden brown and the frangipane filling is set. If they start browning too quickly, you can loosely tent them with foil.
15. As soon as the scrolls come out of the oven, brush the warm almond syrup generously over the tops. This adds moisture, sweetness, and a lovely sheen.
16. Transfer the scrolls to a wire rack to cool slightly. Once cooled, you can dust them lightly with icing sugar for a final flourish, if desired.

#### Notes:
- These are best enjoyed warm on the day they are baked.
- Don’t overfill: While it is tempting, don’t put too much frangipane, or it might ooze out excessively during baking. If you find you’ve got too much almond frangipane, you can store the leftovers securely in an airtight container with glad wrap pressed to the top, and use any way you like (you can even just bake it on top of a slice of bread!)
- A tight roll is key to getting neat, defined spirals in your scrolls.
- Proofing is critical! Under-proofed scrolls will be dense; over-proofed ones can collapse. Look for that visibly puffy, light, and airy feel.
- Storage: These are best eaten fresh. If you have leftovers, store them in an airtight container at room temperature for a day or two.
