#### Instructions
1. Prepare the Sweet Potato
	1. Steam or boil the cubed sweet potatoes until very tender (about 15-20 minutes). Alternatively, fork-stab whole sweet potatoes, roast at 200°C for 45-60 minutes until very soft, then scoop out the flesh.
	2. Drain well if boiled. Mash thoroughly until completely smooth - you should have about 300g (approx 1 1/4 cups) of smooth puree. Allow to cool to lukewarm.
2. Make the Cake Layers
	1. Preheat oven to 180°C. Grease and flour two 20cm round cake tins, and line the bases with baking paper.
	2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking soda, salt, ground cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg. Set aside.
	3. In a large bowl, using an electric mixer, beat together the oil, brown sugar, and granulated sugar until well combined. 
	4. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract and the cooled sweet potato puree until just combined.
	5. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients in three additions, alternating with the buttermilk (dry → buttermilk → dry → buttermilk → dry). Mix until just combined - do not overmix.
	6. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake tins and smooth the tops.
	7. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the centre of the cakes comes out clean.
	8. Let the cakes cool in their tins for about 15 minutes before inverting them onto a wire rack to cool completely - usually a couple of hours.
3. Assemble The Cake
	1. Once the cake layers are completely cool, level the tops if necessary using a serrated knife for an even surface.
	2. Place one cake layer onto your serving plate or cake stand. Spread the chilled cream cheese filling evenly over the top.
	3. Carefully place the second cake layer on top of the filling.
	4. Generously cover the top (and sides if you want) of the cake with the marshmallow frosting, smoothing or creating swirls as you prefer.
	5. To Toast (Optional but recommended): Carefully use a kitchen blowtorch to toast the marshmallow frosting, moving the flame continuously to get an even golden-brown, toasted appearance. Watch it closely as it toasts quickly!
	6. If not toasting, the cake will still be delicious with the plain marshmallow frosting.

#### Notes:
- This cake is best served on the day it’s made, especially once the frosting is toasted.
- Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. The toasted marshmallow texture might soften slightly upon refrigeration. Allow slices to come to room temperature for about 20-30 minutes before serving for best flavour and texture.
