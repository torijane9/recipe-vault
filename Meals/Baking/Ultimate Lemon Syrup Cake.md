#### Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 160°C. Grease and line a cake tin with baking paper on the bottom.
2. Cream butter and sugar with an electric mixer until combined. Add lemon zest, and continue beating until the mixture turns lightens to a pale yellow colour.
3. In a separate bowl, mix eggs and extra yolks together with a fork until combined. Beat the eggs into the butter and sugar mixture a little at a time, until fully combined.
4. Sift flour and baking powder together into the butter mixture, and fold in along with the sour cream using a large spoon. 
5. Spoon mixture into the prepared cake tin. Bake for about 40 minutes, or until a skewer in the centre comes out clean, and the top springs back when lightly pressed.
6. To make the syrup, dissolve the sugar in the lemon juice (you can microwave or heat in a small saucepan). 
7. After the cake has cooled slightly, use a skewer to poke small holes all over the cake and pour syrup carefully over top.
8. Cool cake in the tin so all the syrup gets soaked in. Remove and place on serving plate, slice, and enjoy!

#### Notes:
- This is quite a dense cake, so depending on your oven the top of the cake might start browning while the centre is still very liquid. If this happens, you can cover the cake with tinfoil to stop browning while the cake cooks properly in the centre - just make sure to keep checking it.
