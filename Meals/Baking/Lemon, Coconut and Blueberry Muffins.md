**Lemon, Coconut and Blueberry Muffins**
Ingredients
Dry:
1 ½ cups of flour
1 ½ teaspoons baking powder
½ teaspoon baking soda
½ teaspoon salt
¼ - ½ cup desiccated or shredded coconut
Optional: 2 Tablespoons poppy seeds
Wet:
Zest from 2 large lemons (about 2 Tablespoons)
1⁄3 cup sugar (can use coconut sugar)
1 large tablespoon scoop honey
2 large eggs
½ cup yoghurt
¼ cup freshly squeezed lemon juice (from 1 large lemon)
¼ cup melted and cooled coconut oil
¾ cup blueberries (optional)
Method:

1. Preheat oven to 180°C. Line a 12 cup muffin tin with 9 muffin liners and spray the inside of the liners with nonstick cooking spray (or cook without the muffin liners).
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, coconut, and poppy seeds. Set aside.
3. In a separate large bowl add lemon zest and sugar and use your fingers to rub the lemon zest into the sugar for at least 30 seconds to infuse the sugar with lemon flavor. Mix in honey, then add the eggs one at a time. Onces combined, add the yoghurt and lemon juice, and mix together until smooth and well combined. Gently fold in the dry ingredients until just combined, then stir in melted and cooled coconut oil.
4. Divide batter evenly between the muffin cups. Bake for 15-20 minutes or until tester comes out clean.
