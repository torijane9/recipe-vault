#### Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 180°C. Grease a shallow 23cm/9in square baking tin and line with non-stick baking paper, leaving the paper long enough over 2 opposite sides to help with lifting the slice out after cooked.
2. To make the base, sift the plain flour, self-raising flour, and icing sugar in a large bowl. Rub in butter with your fingertips until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs (this can also be done by pulsing in a food processor).
3. Stir in the egg yolk until the mixture just comes together. Press into the prepared baking tin and chill for 10 minutes.
4. Bake the base for 15 minutes, or until golden brown. Allow to cool.
5. Once the base has cooled, spread the jam evenly over top.
6. In a medium-sized bowl, beat the caster sugar and eggs together until creamy, then stir in the coconut.
7. Spread the coconut mixture over the jam, gently pressing down with the back of a spoon.
8. Bake for a further 25-30 minutes, or until lightly golden. 
9. Leave to cool in the tin, then use the overhanging baking paper to carefully lift the slice out of the tin. Cut into squares and serve.

#### Notes:
- You could use lemon curd instead of jam to make a coconut lemon slice instead
