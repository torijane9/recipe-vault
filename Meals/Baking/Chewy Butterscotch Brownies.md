 Chewy Butterscotch Brownies
Tender, rich and temptingly sweet, my butterscotch brownies balance that brown-sugary goodness with a nice hint of salt to make this the perfect treat for almost any occasion!

#### Ingredients

3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons flour
1 1/4 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup plus 2 tablespoons dark brown sugar
5 tablespoons butter, melted
1 extra-large egg
1/2 plus 1/8 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons coarsely chopped toasted walnuts

#### Method

Heat the oven to 160C.
In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder and salt and set aside.
In a large bowl, stir the brown sugar into the melted butter. Stir in the egg, then the vanilla.
Stir in the dry ingredients, then fold in the nuts.
Place the batter in a greased 8-inch square baking pan and bake until set (a toothpick inserted will have moist crumbs), 25 to 30 minutes.
Remove from heat and cool slightly before serving.
Fold in chopped white chocolate
