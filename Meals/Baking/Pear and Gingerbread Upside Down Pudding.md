#### Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 180°C. Grease and line base and sides of a 20cm round cake tin.
2. Prepare the base. Stir the butter and sugar together in a saucepan, until the sugar has dissolved. Pour evenly over the base of the prepared cake tin and arrange the pears in the tin cut-side down.
3. Into a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, ground ginger, and nutmeg and make a well in the centre.
4. Stir together the brown sugar, milk, golden syrup, butter, and egg and pour into the dry ingredients. Mix together, and pour the mixture carefully over the pears.
5. Bake in the preheated oven for 40-45 minutes, or until a cake skewer inserted in the middle comes out clean. Allow the cake to cool slightly before turning out onto a serving plate.
