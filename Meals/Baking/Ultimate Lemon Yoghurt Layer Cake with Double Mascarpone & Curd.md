#### Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 160°C. Grease and flour two 20cm round cake tins. Line the bottoms with baking paper.
2. Combine lemon juice with the yoghurt.
3. In a medium bowl, whisk together the plain flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.
4. In a large bowl, using an electric mixer, beat the softened butter, granulated sugar, and lemon zest together on medium-high speed until light, pale, and fluffy (about 3-5 minutes). Scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed.
5. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition and scraping down the bowl. Beat in vanilla extract.
6. Add in the dry ingredients in three additions, alternating with the yoghurt (Dry → Yogurt → Dry → Yogurt → Dry). Mix only until just combined after each addition - be careful not to overmix. The batter will be thick.
7. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake tins and smooth the tops.
8. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the centre of the cakes comes out clean, and the tops are golden brown and spring back when lightly touched.
9. Let the cakes cool in their tins on a wire rack for 15 minutes before carefully inverting them onto the wire rack to cool completely. Peel off the baking parchment. 
10. Assembly: Once the cake layers are completely cool, if they have domed tops, you can use a long serrated knife to carefully level them for easier stacking.
11. Place one cake layer onto your serving plate or cake stand. Spread about 1/2 to 3-4 cup of chilled lemon curd evenly over the top of the cake layer, leaving a small border around the edge.
12. Gently spoon or pipe the chilled mascarpone on top of the lemon curd, spreading it carefully to cover.
13. Carefully place the second cake layer on top of the filling. Press down gently to secure.
14. Spread or pipe the lemon mascarpone frosting generously over the top of the cake. 
15. Drizzle, dollop, or swirl extra lemon curd on top of the frosting. Add some dehydrated lemon slices. Sprinkle some extra fresh lemon zest to add a final pop of colour and aroma.
16. Chill the assembled and frosted cake in the fridge for at least 1-2 hours (or longer) before slicing and serving. This allows the frosting and filling to set properly, making it easier to slice neatly, and lets the flavours melt. 
17. For the best flavour and texture, remove the cake from the fridge about 20-30 minutes before serving to allow it to come to room temperature.
#### Notes:
- For the best flavour, use fresh lemons for their zest and juice.
- Ensure your cold ingredients like eggs and yoghurt are at room temperature for the cake batter for better incorporation, unless specified otherwise.
