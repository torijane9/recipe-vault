Nut free

#### **Ingredients:**

* 50g melted butter
* ¾ cup brown sugar
* 1 cup plain flour
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* ½ cup (125mL) milk
* 1 egg
* ¼ cup golden syrup
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* Sauce ¾ cup brown sugar
* 1 tablespoon cornflour
* ¼ cup golden syrup

**Method:**
Preheat oven to 180°C.
Grease a 1-litre ovenproof dish with some of the melted butter.
Combine sugar, flour and baking powder in a large bowl, mix well (I use a whisk).
Add milk, egg, butter, golden syrup and vanilla and stir well to combine.
Spoon mixture into dish.
For the sauce, combine sugar and cornflour in a bowl then sprinkle over cake mixture.
Dissolve golden syrup in ¾ cup of hot water and pour over top (I pour in a spiral pattern from the outside in).
Bake for 35-40 minutes.
Let stand for 5 minutes to avoid burning your tongue on hot, hot sauce.
Serve with cream or ice-cream.

#### **Notes:**

* This is really very simple to make and tastes so much better than the packet mixes!
* Treat yourself to a wonderful winter warmer.

Make this recipe gluten-free using gluten-free flour (I like Orgran brand from supermarket) and gluten-free baking powder.
