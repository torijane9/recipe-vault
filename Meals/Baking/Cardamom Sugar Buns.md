#### Instructions
1. Make [[Laminated Dough]] according to recipe instructions.
2. Butter your baking dishes - you can use soufflé moulds, ramekins, or muffin tins. 
3. Line the bottom of each mould with baking paper, and then generously coat with granulated sugar, tapping out any excess. Place the moulds on a baking sheet.
4. In a small bowl, mix together the filling ingredients except for the butter.
5. Roll the dough into an approximately 30cm x 40cm rectangle. Brush the dough with the melted butter, and sprinkle the cinnamon-sugar filling mixture evenly over the top, pressing it lightly into the butter so it adheres.
6. Starting at the long side, roll the dough into a tight cylinder. Pinch the seam gently to seal it, and position the dough seam side down.
7. Use a sharp knife to cut the dough into equal pieces to fit in your tin moulds. 
8. Transfer the dough pieces to the prepared tins and place them cut side up. Cover loosely with glad wrap and let the dough rise until doubled, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. 
9. While the dough is rising, preheat the oven to 190°C and move the oven rack to the middle lower position.
10. Once the dough has risen and the oven is at temperature, remove the glad wrap and place in the oven to bake.
11. While the rolls are baking, prepare the sugar coating by mixing the granulated sugar and cardamom together.
12. Once cooked, transfer the baking pan to a wire rack and let the rolls cool for a few minutes. 
13. Use a dry kitchen towel or oven mitts to pick up the moulds, then run a knife carefully around the edges of each bun, before flipping the buns onto the wire rack.
14. Toss the hot buns in the sugar cardamom coating, and let cool slightly before serving.
