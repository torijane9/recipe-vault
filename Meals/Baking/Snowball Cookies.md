## Snowball Cookies

### Ingredients
- [ ] 225g unsalted butter, softened
- [ ] 60g (1/2 cup) icing sugar
- [ ] 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
- [ ] 280g (2 1/4 cups) all-purpose flour
- [ ] 1/4 tsp fine sea salt
- [ ] 3/4 cup chopped walnuts or pecans
- [ ] Extra icing sugar, for rolling
---
### Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 200°C.
2. In a large mixing bowl, cream together the butter, icing sugar, and vanilla with an electric mixer until combined and smooth.
3. Sift together the flour and salt. Add the flour gradually to the butter mixture, along with the chopped nuts, until well-combined. 
4. If the mixture is too soft to roll the cookies, you can chill the dough for about 30 minutes in the fridge. 
5. Prepare an oven tray with baking paper. Form 1 Tbsp scoops of dough into balls, and place on the oven tray.
6. Bake cookies for about 10-15 minutes, or until the cookies are a very light golden brown and set. 
7. Allow cookies to cool slightly for a couple of minutes (or until you can handle them), then roll each one in the extra icing sugar until coated.
8. Place on a rack to cool. Once the cookies are cooled, you may want to roll them in more icing sugar.

#### Notes
- Store in an airtight container.
