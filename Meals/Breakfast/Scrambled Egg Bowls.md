#### Instructions
1.  Add breakfast sausage to a skillet over medium-high heat, break up and crumble. Add salt and pepper and stir to combine. Cook until sausage is browned and cooked through, then remove from the skillet into a bowl and set aside.
2. Dice onion, and any other vegetables you are using that need to be cooked. Using the skillet that the sausage was cooked in, add diced vegetables on a medium-high heat. Season with a pinch or two of salt and stir. Cook until vegetables are tender, stirring occasionally. 
3. Return cooked sausage back into the skilled, add minced garlic and any other add-ins you are using that don’t need to be pre-cooked, and stir to combine. Remove from heat.
4. To assemble: Using a jar or meal prep container, add roughly 1/2 cup of the sausage and vegetable mixture to each container. Evenly divide the grated cheese between the containers. Secure the lid and store in the fridge or freezer.
5. **To prepare a breakfast bowl:** Crack two eggs into the meal container. Stir to combine, then microwave on high for 45 seconds. Stir to distribute contents. Microwave further in 30 second increments until the egg is cooked, and enjoy!
#### Notes:
- After cooking the egg, you can add in any extra garnishes such as chopped herbs or green onion etc if you want to.
