### Instructions
1. Mix Dry Ingredients: In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and baking soda.
2. Combine Wet Ingredients: In another bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, eggs, melted butter, corn, and jalapeños (if using) until well combined.
3. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, and fold together until just combined.
4. Heat oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat. Using a spoon, scoop the batter and drop it into the hot oil. Fry a few fritters at a time, being careful not to overcrowd the pan.
5. Fry the fritters for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until they are golden brown and crispy.
6. Once cooked, remove from the frying pan and place them on a baking sheet lined with paper towels to drain any excess oil.

#### Notes
- These could also be cooked in a deep fryer if you want.
