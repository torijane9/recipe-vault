#### Instructions
1. Make yoghurt spread: place yoghurt in a medium bowl and add in garlic; mix to combine. Season with pepper and salt. Add dill and parsley and mix thoroughly, and set aside at room temperature.
2. Make chilli butter: melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat; heat until bubbles begin to burst. Add chilli flakes, paprika, and cumin. Stir until colour is uniform. Turn off heat and let spices infuse.
3. Make parsley and jalapeno oil: grind parsley and jalapeno together in a mortar. Drizzle in olive oil and season with salt; stir to combine.
4. Make poached eggs: fill a large saucepan with water and bring to a rolling boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, add vinegar, and keep water at a gentle simmer. Crack and egg into a small bowl, then gently slip egg into water. Repeat with the remaining egg(s) depending on serving size. Cook eggs until whites are firm and yolks have thickened but are not hard, approximately 2 1/2 - 3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and place onto a warm plate.
5. Dollop yoghurt mixture onto serving plates or bowls. Use the back of a spoon to spread yoghurt, swirling the yoghurt to form ridges to catch the oil and butter. Drizzle some jalapeno oil. Top with eggs and 1-2 spoonfuls of chilli butter. Sprinkle sea salt on top, and any other garnishes you prefer. 
6. Eat with slices of bread and enjoy.
