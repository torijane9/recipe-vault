#### Instructions
1. Make poached eggs: fill a large saucepan with water and bring to a rolling boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, add vinegar, and keep water at a gentle simmer. 
2. Crack and egg into a small bowl, then gently slip egg into water. Repeat with the remaining egg(s) depending on serving size. Cook eggs until whites are firm and yolks have thickened but are not hard, approximately 2 1/2 - 3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and place onto a warm plate.
3. Dollop yoghurt dip onto serving plates or bowls. Use the back of a spoon to spread yoghurt, swirling the yoghurt to form ridges to catch the oil and butter. Drizzle some jalapeno oil. Top with eggs, chickpeas, and 1-2 spoonfuls of chilli butter.  
4. Garnish with your preferred extra garnishes, and enjoy with the toasted bread!
