### Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 190°C.  Liberally grease a 23cm x 33cm baking dish with butter.
2. Crumble the breakfast sausage into a large frying pan and cook over a medium-high heat until thoroughly browned, about 5-7 minutes. Drain any excess fat and set aside. If using bacon, cook it in the same pan until crispy, then drain, crumble, and set aside. (If using pre-cooked ham, you can skip cooking it if you want).
3. Place one layer of the hash browns over the bottom of the prepared baking dish and drizzle with the melted butter.
4. Sprinkle half the cooked meats evenly over the hash brown layer, and follow with half of the grated cheese.
5. Layer the rest of the hash browns on top, followed by the rest of the cooked meats.
6. In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, cream, salt, and pepper until well combined and slightly frothy. 
7. Carefully pout the egg mixture evenly over the layers in the baking disk. Sprinkle the remaining grated cheese over the top.
8. Bake for 45-55 minutes, or until the casserole is golden brown on top, the eggs are fully set in the centre (a knife inserted into the middle should come out clean), and the hash browns are tender.
9. Remove the casserole from the oven and let it stand for 5-10 minutes before slicing and serving. This resting time allows the casserole to set further and makes for cleaner slices. Garnish as preferred.

#### Notes
- This casserole is fantastic for making ahead the night before. Assemble the entire casserole up to step 7 the night before, cover it tightly with plastic wrap or foil, and refrigerate. In the morning, remove it from the fridge while the oven preheats, and then bake as directed, adding an extra 10-15 minutes to the cooking time if it’s going straight from cold into the oven.
- To make a vegetarian version, simply omit the meat and instead add some sauteed vegetables like diced capsicum, onions, mushrooms, or spinach to the casserole layers. Ensure any wet vegetables (like spinach or mushrooms) are well-drained before adding to prevent a watery casserole.
- Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3-4 days. Reheat individual portions in the microwave or oven until warmed through.
