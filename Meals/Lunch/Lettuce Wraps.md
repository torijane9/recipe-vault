#### Instructions
1. Separate the lettuce leaves, then wash and dry. Arrange on a serving plate and set aside.
2. Peel and crush the garlic and ginger.
3. Heat the oil in a frying pan over medium-high heat. Once hot, add in the protein, garlic, and ginger and cook until brown and cooked through, stirring every so often. 
4. Once cooked through, add the fish sauce caramel. Once the caramel has coated the mixture in a glossy sauce, remove from heat. Taste, and add more sauce or seasoning if needed.
5. Serve immediately with lettuce, steamed rice, and other toppings as preferred.
