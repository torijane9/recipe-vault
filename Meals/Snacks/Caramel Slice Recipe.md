Caramel Slice Recipe

1/2 cup plain flour
1/2 cup self raising flour
1 cup desiccated coconut
1/2 cup Chelsea Soft Brown Sugar
100g butter

Filling
30g butter
2 Tbsp Chelsea Golden Syrup
400g can sweetened condensed milk

Topping
130g cooking chocolate
30g butter

Method
Preheat oven to 180°C. Put aluminium foil in a shallow 29cm x 21cm slice dish.
Base: Sift flours into a bowl, add coconut. Combine brown sugar and butter in a pan until sugar has dissolved. Add mixture to the flours and stir. Press into tin with back of spoon, bake for 10 mins or until brown.
Filling: Combine butter, Golden Syrup and condensed milk in a saucepan. Stir for 5 to 10 mins until mixture boils and browns (watch it doesn't burn on bottom). Smooth over the base and bake for 15-20 minutes until just starting to caramelise around the edges.
Topping: Combine chocolate and butter in a heatproof bowl, stand over pan of boiling water until melted. Allow the filling to cool before spreading over the chocolate topping.
