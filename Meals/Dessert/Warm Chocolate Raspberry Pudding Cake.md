Warm Chocolate Raspberry Pudding Cake

For frosting:
3 ounces fine-quality bittersweet chocolate (not unsweetened)
1/2 cup seedless raspberry jam (about 5 ounces)
1/2 cup heavy cream
For cake batter:
1/2 cup boiling water
1/3 cup plus 2 teaspoons unsweetened cocoa powder (not Dutch
process)
1/4 cup whole milk
1/2 teaspoon vanilla
1/3 cup seedless raspberry jam (about 3‚ ounces)
1 stick (1/2 cup) unsalted butter, softened
1/3 cup packed light brown sugar
1/3 cup granulated sugar
2 large eggs
1 cup all-purpose flour
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon salt
Garnish: raspberries
What you’ll do:
Preheat oven to 350°F. and butter a 9- by 2-inch round cake pan generously (I used a spring pan).
Make frosting:
Chop chocolate coarsely- doesn’t have to be perfect. In a small heavy saucepan bring jam, cream, and chocolate to a simmer, stirring occasionally, until smooth.Pour frosting into cake pan. Like I said above, I doubled the frosting quantity. I think next time I would do it one and a half times.
Make cake batter:
In a bowl whisk together boiling water and cocoa powder until smooth then whisk in milk, vanilla, and jam. In a large bowl with an electric mixer beat together butter and sugars until light and fluffy. Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. In a separate bowl sift together dry ingredients–flour, baking soda, and salt. Add to egg mixture in batches alternately with cocoa mixture, making sure to begin and end with flour mixture. Beat well after each addition.
Pour batter evenly over frosting mixture and bake in middle of oven 30 to 35 minutes, or until a tester inserted into cake comes out clean (frosting on bottom will still be liquid). Cool cake slightly in pan on a rack, 10 to 20 minutes.
You can make the cake 1 day ahead. To do this cool completely in pan and leave in pan, covered, at room temperature. Reheat cake, uncovered, at 350°F. 10 to 15 minutes. Run a thin knife around edge of pan and twist pan gently back and forth on a flat surface to loosen cake. Invert a cake plate with a slight lip over cake pan and, holding pan and plate together with both hands, invert cake onto plate. Frosting will cover cake and run onto plate. Serve cake garnished with raspberries.
