#### Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 180°C. Grease a 25cm x 30xm swiss roll pan. Line the base and two long sides with baking paper.
2. Beat egg yolks and sugar in a small bowl with an electric mixer until thick and creamy. Transfer mixture to a large bowl. 
3. Sift and combine cocoa powder and cornflour. Add to the egg mixture, followed by the first measure of chocolate, and the water. 
4. Beat egg whites with an electric mixer until soft peaks form. Fold egg whites, in two batches, into egg-chocolate mixture. 
5. Spread mixture into the prepared pan. Bake for about 15 minutes, then turn the cake onto a baking-paper-covered wire rack to cool.
6. Grease a 23cm round springform tin. Line the sides with baking paper, ensuring the paper extends 5cm above the top of the tin. Cut a 23cm-diameter circle from the cooled cake and place in bottom of the tin.
7. Dissolve coffee in the hot water in a small jug and allow to cool. 
8. Beat cream and coffee mixture in a medium bowl with an electric mixer until soft peaks form. Fold in the second measure of melted chocolate (ensure it’s not too hot). 
9. Pour mixture over the cake in the tin. Cover and refrigerate for about 3 hours or until set. 
10. Transfer cake from tin to serving plate and dust with sifted extra cocoa.

#### Notes:
- If you are wanting more decoration for the cake, before dusting with cocoa powder, you could add piped whipped cream swirls, and top each swirl with a chocolate-covered coffee bean
