### Ingredients
- [ ] 80g (1/2 cup) small sago pearls

- [ ] 1 can (400ml) full-fat coconut milk
- [ ] 250ml (1 cup) whole milk or water (for a richer or lighter pudding, respectively)

- [ ] 1 pandan leaf, knotted (or 1/4 tsp pandan essence)
- [ ] Small pinch of salt

### Instructions
Prepare the sago pearls:
1. Do not soak beforehand. Place them in a fine-mesh sieve and give them a very quick rinse under cold water to wash off excess starch. 
2. Bring the 750ml of water to a rolling boil in a medium saucepan. Add the rinsed sago pearls and stir immediately to stop them from clumping together.
3. Reduce the heat to a medium simmer and cook for 10-12 minutes, stirring occasionally. The pearls will start to become translucent, but most will still have a small, opaque white dot in the centre.
4. Drain the sago through the sieve and rinse thoroughly under cold water. This stops the cooking process and removes excess starch, which helps keep the pearls distinct. Set aside.
Make the coconut pudding:
5. In the same saucepan (wiped clean), combine the coconut milk, whole milk (or water), caster sugar, pinch of salt, and knotted pandan leaf (if using). 
6. Heat over a medium-low heat, stirring gently until the sugar has completely dissolved. Do not let it boil, as this may cause the coconut milk to split. You just want it hot and steamy. 
7. Add the sago pearls and the pandan extract (if using instead of pandan leaf) to the warm coconut milk mixture. Bring it back to a very gentle simmer.
8. Cook for another 5-10 minutes, stirring frequently to prevent sticking, until the sago pearls are fully translucent. The pudding will thicken slightly as it cooks and will thicken more as it cools. 
9. Remove from the heat, and take out the knotted pandan leaf if used. Let the pudding cool to room temperature, then transfer to the fridge to chill completely for at least 2 hours.
