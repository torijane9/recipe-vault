#### Instructions
1.  **Prepare the Chocolate Base:** In a medium-large saucepan over a very low heat, or in a microwave-safe bowl in 30-second bursts (stirring well between each), gently melt the milk chocolate, dark chocolate, double cream, and unsalted butter together. Stir continuously until the mixture is completely smooth and glossy. Be careful not to overheat.
2.  **Add Flavour:** Remove from the heat and stir in the ¾ tsp of sea salt flakes. This will really enhance the chocolate flavour.
3.  **Divide and Assemble:** Carefully divide the molten chocolate mixture evenly among your four small disposable foil trays, spreading it across the bottom of each.
4.  **Top with Marshmallows:** Arrange the marshmallows over the chocolate layer in each tray, ensuring they cover the surface completely. You'll need about 6-8 large marshmallows per tray, depending on their size.
5.  **Bake/Grill:**
    *   **Oven Method:** Preheat your oven to 180°C (160°C fan / 350°F / Gas Mark 4). Place all four trays on a baking tray and bake for 5-7 minutes, or until the chocolate is bubbling around the edges and the marshmallows have puffed up slightly.
    *   **Grill (Broiler) Method (Recommended for Marshmallows):** For perfectly toasted marshmallows, preheat your grill to medium-high. Place the trays (you might need to do this in batches if all four don't fit under the grill at once) about 10-15 cm (4-6 inches) from the heat source. Grill for 2-4 minutes, turning the trays if necessary, until the marshmallows are beautifully golden brown and gooey. *Watch them like a hawk – they can go from perfect to burnt in seconds!*
6.  **Serve Immediately:** Carefully remove the hot trays from the oven or grill. Best served immediately while the chocolate is wonderfully warm and dippable, alongside the [[Salty-Sweet Malted Cookie Bars]] for dipping!
