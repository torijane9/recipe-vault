### Instructions
Prepare the biscuit base:
1. Place the digestive biscuits in a food processor and blitz until they form fine crumbs. Alternatively, put them in a strong freezer bag and bash them with a rolling pin.
2. Melt the butter gently in a small saucepan or in the microwave.
3. Pour the melted butter over the biscuit crumbs and mix well until evenly combined. The mixture should look like wet sand.
4. Divide the crumb mixture evenly among 6 individual dessert pots. Press it down firmly into the bottom of each pot using the back of a spoon.
5. Pop these into the fridge to chill and firm up while the other layers are prepared.
Cook the sago pearls:
6. In a medium saucepan, bring 600ml of water to a rolling boil.
7. Add the sago pearls, stirring constantly for the first minute to prevent them from sticking.
8. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 10-15 minutes, or until most of the pearls are translucent with just a tiny white dot remaining in their centres. They’ll finish cooking when they cool.
9. Drain the sago through a fine-mesh sieve and rinse under cold running water to remove excess starch and stop the cooking process. Leave to drain thoroughly.
Make the mango puree:
10. Take the 2 large mangoes for the mousse (around 600g). Roughly chop the flesh.
11. Place the chopped mango into a blender or food processor and blitz until completely smooth. You should have about 300-350ml of puree. Set aside.
To assemble:
12. In a large bowl, whisk the chilled coconut cream until it’s smooth and slightly fluffy. 
13. In a separate bowl, whip the cream with the caster sugar until it forms soft peaks. Be careful not to over-whip!
14. **If using gelatine**: 
	1. Sprinkle the gelatine powder evenly over 60ml of hot water in a small, heatproof bowl. Stir briefly, then let it sit for 5 minutes to ‘bloom’. Once ‘bloomed’ and thickened, gently heat it in the microwave for 10-15 seconds, or over a double boiler, until it’s fully dissolved and clear.
	2. Take about 100ml of the prepared mango puree and gently warm it if it’s cold - you want it warm enough to dissolve the gelatine, but not hot. Stir the dissolved gelatine into the warm mango puree until fully combined.
	3. Pour the gelatine-mango mixture back into the rest of the mango puree. Add the lime juice and stir well.
15. **If using agar-agar:
	1. Take out about 60ml (4 Tbsp) of the mango puree for the mousse.
	2. In a small saucepan, whisk the agar-agar powder into the mango puree. Make sure there are no lumps - a small whisk is really handy here.
	3. Place the saucepan over a medium heat and bring the mixture to a gentle boil, stirring constantly. You need to boil agar-agar for it to dissolve properly and activate its setting power.
	4. Once boiling, reduce the heat slightly and simmer, still stirring, for 1-2 minutes. You should see that the powder has completely dissolved and the mixture looks clear and slightly thickened. If it still looks grainy, keep simmering and stirring until it’s perfectly smooth.
	5. Immediately take it off the heat, and pour into the remaining mango puree. Whisk thoroughly and quickly to fully combine the hot agar-agar mixture with the rest of the puree. You need to work quickly here because the agar-agar starts to set as it cools, even at room temperature.
16. Gently fold the whipped coconut cream into the mango puree mixture until just combined.
17. Next, very carefully fold in the whipped cream. You want to maintain as much air as possible to create the lovely mousse texture.
18. Take half of the sago pearls and gently fold into the mousse mixture. 
19. Spoon or pour the mousse evenly over the chilled biscuit bases in the dessert pots. 
20. Return the pots to the fridge to chill and set for at least 3-4 hours, or preferably overnight, until the mousse is firm.
Prepare the mango topping:
21. Once the mousse is set, you can prepare the topping. 
22. Dice the remaining large mango into small, neat cubes. 
23. In a small bowl, gently mix the diced mango with the extra 100g of mango puree. This will help the diced mango stay juicy and cohesive on top. 
24. Combine this mango topping with the remaining sago pearls.
Garnish and serve:
25. Just before serving, spoon the mango topping mixture evenly over the set mousse in each pot. 
26. Sprinkle with desiccated coconut and pop a fresh mint sprig on top for extra flourish and refreshing aroma.
27. Serve these dessert pots chilled, and enjoy!

#### Notes
- Mango choice: Always use ripe, sweet mangoes for the best flavour. You want a mango variety that is sweet and less fibrous.
- Coconut cream: Chilling the can of full-fat coconut cream overnight helps the solid cream separate from the liquid, making it easier to scoop out the thick cream for whipping.
- Gelatine vs Agar-agar: agar-agar tends to give a firmer, slightly less ‘melty’ mouthfeel than gelatine. It’s still absolutely delicious, but it’s good to know what to expect. Think more along the lines of a creamy panna cotta, rather than a super airy mousse. Agar-agar is still a fantastic vegetarian option.
- These dessert pots are fantastic for making ahead! They can be prepared up to 2 days in advance and store them, covered, in the fridge. Just add the fresh mango topping and garnish right before serving to keep everything looking its best.
