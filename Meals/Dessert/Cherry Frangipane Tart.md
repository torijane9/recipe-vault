### Ingredients
#ingredients 
- [ ] [[Sweet Shortcrust Pastry]]
- [ ] [[Frangipane Filling]]

- [ ] 2 Tbsp cherry jam
- [ ] 1 Tbsp hot water

#### Instructions
1. To prepare the [[Sweet Shortcrust Pastry]]: Lightly flour your work surface and rolling pin. Roll out the chilled pastry disc into a large enough circle to line a 23cm fluted tart tin with a removable base and about 3-4mm thickness.
2. Carefully lift the pastry and drape it over the tart tin. Gently press it into the base and up the sides. Trim any excess pastry from the edges, leaving a slight overhand. You can patch up any tears with leftover pastry.
3. Prick the base of the pastry all over with a fork, then place the lined tart tin into the fridge for about 20 minutes to prevent shrinkage during baking.
4. Preheat oven to 180°C (160°C fan / 350°F / Gas Mark 4).
5. To blind bake the pastry: line the chilled pastry case with baking paper, ensuring it covers the base and comes up the sides. Fill it with ceramic baking beans, dried beans, or rice.
6. Bake for 15 minutes.
7. Carefully remove the baking beans and parchment. Return the pastry to the oven for another 5-10 minutes, or until the base is dry and lightly golden. This “blind baking” will ensure a crisp base that won’t get soggy from the filling.
8. Remove from the oven and let it cool slightly while you make the frangipane.
9. Make the [[Frangipane Filling]]. 
10. Assemble the tart: Pour the frangipane filling into the cooled pastry case and spread it evenly with a spatula. 
11. Scatter the pitted cherries over the frangipane. If using frozen cherries, add them directly from the freezer - don’t thaw them or they’ll release too much liquid. Gently press the cherries down slightly into the frangipane.
12. Bake for 35-45 minutes, or until the frangipane is golden brown, puffed up, and set in the centre. You can test for doneness by gently pressing the centre; it should feel firm to the touch. If the edges are browning too quickly, you can loosely cover them with foil.
13. Remove the tart from the oven and let it cool completely on a wire rack before attempting to remove it from the tin - frangipane can be quite delicate when warm.
14. Glazing is optional but recommended for shine and flavour: While the tart is cooling, gently heat the cherry jam with the hot water in a small saucepan over a low heat (or in the microwave), stirring until smooth and liquid.
15. Once the tart is completely cool, brush the warm glaze over the cherries and frangipane for a beautiful shine and extra burst of cherry flavour.
