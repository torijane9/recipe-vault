#### Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 220°C. 
2. Beat the egg whites in a bowl with an electric mixer until stiff peaks start to form. 
3. Gradually add the caster sugar while the mixer is running. Add the vanilla and continue to mix for 5-6 minutes until thick and glossy. Use a spatula to fold in the cocoa.
4. Take two baking trays, and place a sheet of baking paper on each one. Draw a 21cm circle on each sheet of paper.
5. Divide the meringue mixture between both circles and use the back of a spoon to spread the meringue to fill the circles.
6. Place both trays in the oven and immediately reduce the temperature to 120°C. Bake for 90 minutes, then turn the oven off and leave the meringues inside to cool completely before removing.
7. Beat the cream, icing sugar, and vanilla extract in a large bowl until you have soft peaks, then fold in the yoghurt.
8. To assemble, place one cooled meringue on a cake plate or serving platter. Spread with half the cream mixture and arrange half of the berries over the cream. Place the second meringue on top gently, then spread the remaining cream, pile high with remaining berries, and scatter the hazelnuts over the top.
9. Serve immediately.

#### Notes:
- The meringues can be made up to 2 days ahead before assembling the cake.
