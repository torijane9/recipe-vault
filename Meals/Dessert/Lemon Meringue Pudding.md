3. Combine cream, vanilla extract, and lemon rind and juice in a small saucepan over low heat, stirring until hot.
4. Whisk eggs and sugar in a large bowl until combined.
5. Whisking constantly, slowly pour the hot cream mixture into the egg mixture. Once combined, pour into the dish over the sponge cake.
6. Bake pudding for approx. 45 minutes; remove from oven and increase oven temperature to 180° .
7. Cool pudding for 10 minutes, then carefully spread lemon curd over the surface.
8. Make meringue topping: Beat egg whites in a small bowl with an electric mixer until soft peaks form. Add sugar gradually, beating until the sugar has dissolved. 
9. Spoon meringue topping over pudding to completely cover the surface. 
10. Bake pudding for about another 15 minutes or until browned lightly. 
11. Serve hot with cream or ice cream.

#### Notes:
- Depending on the size, you’ll probably need one lemon for both the juice and zest.
