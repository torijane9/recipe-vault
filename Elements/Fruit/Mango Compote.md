## Mango Compote

### Ingredients
- [ ] 1 large ripe mango, peeled and diced (about 250g/1 1/2 cups)
- [ ] 2 Tbsp caster sugar
- [ ] 1 Tbsp freshly squeezed lime juice
- [ ] 2 Tbsp water
---
### Instructions
1. Place the diced mango, sugar, lime juice, and water into a small saucepan.
2. Bring to a simmer over a medium heat. Cook for 8-10 minutes, stirring occasionally and gently mashing some of the mango pieces with the back of the spoon. You’re looking for a jammy consistency where the mango has broken down but still has some texture.
3. Remove from the heat and let it cool completely in the fridge.
