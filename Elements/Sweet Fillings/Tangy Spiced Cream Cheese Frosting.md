#### Instructions
1. Ensure the cream cheese is truly at room temperature to avoid lumps.
2. In a medium bowl, using an electric mixer, beat the softened butter and room temperature cream cheese together on medium speed until smooth and creamy.
3. Gradually add the sifted icing sugar, beating on low speed until combined, then increase the speed to medium-high and beat until light and fluffy.
4. Stir in the cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla extract, and lemon juice (if using) until well combined.
5. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to firm up slightly before using. If it becomes too stiff, let it sit at room temperature for 10-15 minutes, and give it a quick mix before using.
