#### Instructions
1. Finely chop the chocolate and place in a medium size bowl.
2. Heat the cream in a small pot. As it is heating, add the instant coffee powder and mix to dissolve.
3. Once the cream comes to a simmer, remove from the heat and pour over the chocolate. Stir until smooth and glossy, and the chocolate is completely melted. 
4. Whisk in the butter until combined.
5. Add the icing sugar and cocoa powder and whisk until completely smooth. 

#### Notes:
- To add some extra flavour to the frosting, once it has cooled slightly you could add 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract, or 1 Tbsp of your favourite liqueur (orange liqueur, coffee liqueur, raspberry or cherry liqueur, etc).
