#### Instructions
1.  In a medium-sized bowl, cream together the softened butter and caster sugar until light and fluffy. An electric mixer makes this quicker, but a wooden spoon works too!
2. Beat in eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition until fully incorporated.
3. Stir in the ground almonds, plain flour, almond extract, vanilla extract, and pinch of salt until just combined. Don’t overmix.
