## Dark Cherry and Blood Orange Curd

### Ingredients
- [ ] 300g (about 2 cups) frozen pitted dark cherries
- [ ] 120ml (1/2 cup) juice from 2-3 blood oranges
- [ ] 150g (3/4 cup) caster sugar
- [ ] 4 large egg yolks
- [ ] 1 whole large egg
- [ ] Pinch of salt
- [ ] 85g unsalted butter, cold and cubed
---
### Instructions
1. Place the frozen cherries in a small saucepan and heat gently until they have thawed and released their juices. Use a stick blender to blitz them into a smooth puree. Strain to remove any pieces of cherry skin.
2. Fill a medium saucepan with a few centimetres of water and bring it to a gentle simmer. Find a heatproof bowl that fits snugly on top of the saucepan without touching the water.
3. In the heatproof bowl (off the heat), whisk together the cherry puree, blood orange juice, sugar, egg yolks, whole egg, and salt until smooth. 
4. Place the bowl over the simmering water. Whisk constantly to prevent the eggs from scrambling. Continue to cook and whisk for 8-10 minutes, until the mixture has noticeably thickened and coats the back of a spoon.
5. Remove the bowl from the heat. Add the cold butter cubes one at a time, whisking until each piece is fully melted and incorporated before adding the next. This makes the curd glossy and silky.
6. Pour the curd into a clean bowl or jar. Press a piece of plastic wrap directly onto the surface of the curd to prevent a skin from forming. Chill in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours, or until completely cold and set.

#### Notes
- This can be made up to 3 days in advance  and kept in an airtight container in the fridge.
