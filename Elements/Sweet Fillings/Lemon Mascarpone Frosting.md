### Lemon Mascarpone Frosting 

### Ingredients
#ingredients 
- [ ] 1 1/2 cups (approx 340g-375g) mascarpone cheese
- [ ] 1/2 - 1 cup icing sugar, sifted (adjust to taste - start with less and add more if needed)
- [ ] Zest of 1 large lemon
- [ ] 1-2 Tbsp fresh lemon juice (start with less less, add more to taste for tang and consistency)
- [ ] 1/4 tsp vanilla extract
---
#### Instructions
1. In a large bowl, using an electric mixer on low speed (or by hand with a whisk), beat the cold mascarpone mascarpone very briefly - just for about 15-30 seconds to loosen it slightly. Be gentle, overmixing is the enemy of mascarpone.
2. Gradually add the sifted icing sugar and lemon zest. Mix on low speed until just combined and smooth.
3. Add 1 Tbsp lemon juice and the vanilla extract. Mix on low speed until incorporated.
4. Taste the frosting - if you’d like it sweeter, add a bit more icing sugar. If you’d like more tang or a slightly thinner consistency, add a little more lemon juice a tsp at a time.
5. If the frosting seems a bit too soft, you can chill it in the refrigerator for 15-30 minutes to help it firm up before using. It should be thick, creamy, and spreadable.
