## Blackberry and Pomegranate Compote

### Ingredients
- [ ] 250g (about 2 cups) blackberries, fresh or frozen
- [ ] 50g (1/4 cup) caster sugar
- [ ] 60ml (1/4 cup) pure pomegranate juice
---
### Instructions
1. Combine the blackberries, sugar, and pomegranate juice in a small saucepan over a medium heat.
2. Bring to a simmer and cook for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally and gently crushing some of the berries with the back of the spoon. The compote is ready when the mixture is thickened slightly and the berries have broken down but still have some texture.
3. Remove from the heat and transfer to a bowl to cool completely.

#### Notes
- This can be made up to 3 days in advance and stored in the fridge until using.
