### Pickled Red Onions 

### Ingredients
#ingredients 
- [ ] 2 medium red onions
- [ ] 240ml (1 cup) water
- [ ] 240ml (1 cup) white wine vinegar (or apple cider vinegar for a slightly frutier tang)
- [ ] 1 Tbsp granulated sugar
- [ ] 1 tsp fine sea salt
---
#### Instructions
1.  **Prepare the Onions:**
    *   Carefully slice the red onions as thinly as possible. A mandoline slicer is fantastic for this if you have one, as it ensures uniform thickness, but a sharp knife will work just as well. You want thin, almost translucent rings or half-moons.
    *   Place the sliced onions into your clean, heatproof jar. Don't pack them too tightly just yet.

2.  **Make the Brine:**
    *   In a small saucepan, combine the water, white wine vinegar, sugar, and salt.
    *   Add any optional flavourings you've chosen (peppercorns, bay leaves, etc.).
    *   Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring until the sugar and salt are completely dissolved. This usually only takes a minute or two once it starts simmering.

3.  **Pour Over Onions:**
    *   Carefully pour the hot brine directly over the sliced red onions in the jar. Make sure the onions are completely submerged. If any bits float, you can gently press them down with the back of a spoon to ensure they're covered.
    *   The hot brine will instantly start to soften the onions and turn them that beautiful vibrant pink colour.

4.  **Cool & Chill:**
    *   Allow the jar to cool down to room temperature on your counter. This usually takes about 30-60 minutes.
    *   Once cool, secure the lid tightly on the jar.
    *   Transfer the jar to the refrigerator.

#### Notes:
*   The pickled red onions will be ready to eat after about 30 minutes in the fridge, but their flavour will deepen and become more pronounced after a few hours, or ideally, overnight. 
* They will keep well in the refrigerator for at least 2-3 weeks, if not longer (some people say up to a month, but generally fresher is better for flavour and texture). 
- **Vinegar Choice:** White wine vinegar gives a crisp, clean flavour. Apple cider vinegar offers a slightly fruitier, more mellow tang. You can even experiment with rice vinegar for an even milder Asian-inspired pickle.
- **Sweetness & Saltiness:** The sugar helps to balance the acidity of the vinegar and mellow the raw onion bite. The salt enhances the flavour and helps draw out moisture. Feel free to adjust the sugar and salt slightly to your taste in future batches.
* **Storage:** Always keep them stored in the refrigerator. They're not shelf-stable like traditional canned pickles.
* **Versatility:** These are fantastic on bagels, burgers, tacos, salads, grilled cheese sandwiches, avocado toast, or as a garnish for almost any savoury dish that needs a little zing!
