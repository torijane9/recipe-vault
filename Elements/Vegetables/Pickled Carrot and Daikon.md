#### Instructions
1. Slice carrots and daikon into matchsticks (or whatever size you want them).
2. In a bowl add enough water to cover the carrots an daikon and 2 tablespoons of salt and mix together. Leave for about half an hour, or until a slice of carrot will bend and not snap if you fold it in half. 
3. Drain the water and dry the carrots and daikon as much as you can, I put them down on a tea towel and press them dry. Place in a 1 litre glass jar that has been sterilised.
4. In a jug add 1/2 cup white sugar to 1/2 white vinegar and stir until the sugar has dissolved, and pour into the jar. 
5. Add boiling water to the top and give a little mix around to make sure everything is covered, then secure the lid.
6. Leave on the bench until cooled, then put in fridge. give at least a couple of hours to start pickling, and then you can eat when you want. The longer you leave them, the stronger the pickle will be.
