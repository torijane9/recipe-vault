## Charred Sweetcorn

### Ingredients
- [ ] 6-8 ears of fresh sweetcorn, husks removed, or about 800g (approx. 5 cups) frozen sweetcorn kernels, thawed

### Instructions
1. If using fresh corn on the cob:
	- Brush the corn lightly with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. There are a few options for charring:
	- Grill: Place the corn directly on a preheated grill over medium-high heat. Turn frequently until kernels are tender and lightly charred all over - this usually takes about 10-15 minutes.
	- Griddle pan: Heat a large griddle pan over medium-high heat. Cook the corn, turning occasionally until charred in spots, for about 12-18 minutes.
	- Oven roast: Preheat oven to 200°C. Place the oiled corn directly onto a baking tray and roast for 15-20 minutes, turning once, until tender and slightly browned.
2. Once the corn is cooked and slightly cooled, carefully cut the kernels off the cobs using a sharp knife. You can stand the cob upright in a large bowl to catch all the kernels and prevent them from scattering.
If using frozen kernels:
3. Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan or cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat.
4. Add the thawed corn kernels and cook, stirring occasionally until some of the kernels are lightly browned and caramelised (about 8-10 minutes). 
5. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper, and set aside until using.
