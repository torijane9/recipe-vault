### Instructions
1. Combine all of the ingredients (except lime wedges) together in a large bowl, and gently mix together until everything is evenly coated in the creamy dressing.
2. Transfer to a serving dish and garnish with a little extra crumbled cheese and some fresh coriander leaves. You could also add a final sprinkle of ancho chilli powder or smoked paprika for colour and flavour.
3. Serve immediately, or you can chill for 30 minutes or so to allow the flavours to meld. Serve with extra lime wedges on the side for squeezing.
