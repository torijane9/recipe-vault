## Grilled Sweetcorn Salsa Salad

### Ingredients
- [ ] [[Charred Sweetcorn]]
- [ ] 1 large red capsicum, deseeded and quartered
- [ ] 1 ripe but firm mango, peeled and diced into 1cm cubes
- [ ] 150g (about 1 cup) cherry tomatoes, halved or quartered
- [ ] 1/2 red onion, finely diced
- [ ] 1 small jalapeno, deseeded and finely chopped (optional, depending on heat preference)

- [ ] [[Smokey Lime Dressing]]

### Instructions
1. Preheat grill or barbecue to a medium-high heat to grill the capsicum. If using a grill pan, ensure it’s well-oiled. You can do this at the same time as charring the corn. 
2. Grill the capsicum quarters, skin-side down first, until the skin is blistered and blackened, and the flesh is tender, about 8-10 minutes.
3. Once grilled, allow the sweetcorn and capsicum to cool slightly. Dice the capsicum into 1cm cubes, similar in size to the mango and cherry tomatoes. 
4. In a large mixing bowl, combine the charred sweetcorn kernels, diced capsicum and mango, halved or quartered cherry tomatoes, diced red onion, chopped jalapeno (if using), and chopped fresh coriander. 
5. Pour the lime dressing over the salad ingredients. Gently toss everything together until all the ingredients are evenly coated.
6. Enjoy immediately, or let it sit for 15-20 minutes for the flavours to meld. 

#### Notes
- You can peel away some of the charred skin of the capsicum if you want, but it’s not strictly necessary as it adds to the smoky flavour of the salad.
- This salad is great served at room temperature, which makes it perfect for picnics or al fresco dining.
