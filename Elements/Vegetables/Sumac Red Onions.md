#### Instructions
1.  **Prepare the Onions:** Begin by thinly slicing your red onions. You can use a mandoline for very even, fine slices, or a sharp knife. The thinner they are, the more readily they’ll absorb the flavours and become less pungent.
2.  **"Wash" the Onions (Optional but Recommended):** For a milder onion flavour and to reduce their raw bite, place the sliced red onions in a colander and rinse them under cold water for about 30 seconds. This step is completely optional, but it helps to mellow their intensity. After rinsing, pat them very dry with a clean tea towel or paper towels. This is important to ensure the dressing isn't watered down.
3.  **Combine Ingredients:** In a medium-sized mixing bowl, add the dried sliced red onions. Sprinkle over the sumac, chopped fresh parsley, and chopped fresh mint.
4.  **Dress the Salad:** Pour in the extra virgin olive oil and fresh lemon juice. Season with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper.
5.  **Massage and Mix:** Using clean hands, gently "massage" the sumac, herbs, and dressing into the red onions for about 1-2 minutes. This crucial step helps to break down the onion slightly, allowing it to soften and release its natural sweetness, while also ensuring the sumac's flavour is fully imparted. You'll notice the onions turning a beautiful vibrant red from the sumac.
6.  **Taste and Adjust:** Taste a small amount of the salad and adjust the seasoning if necessary. You might want a little more salt, pepper, or even an extra squeeze of lemon juice if you prefer it tarter.

#### Notes:
- This salad is best served immediately to maintain its freshness and vibrant texture. However, it can also be made about 30 minutes ahead of time and kept at room temperature, allowing the flavours to meld further.
