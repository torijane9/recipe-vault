#### Instructions
1. Thoroughly rinse rice in cold water and drain.
2. Shake the coconut cream can before opening. Depending on the brand, the coconut cream might still be separated into cream and coconut water, so you want to stir together to combine.
3. Add coconut oil, washed rice, 1 cup of the coconut cream, sugar, and salt together in a medium-size pot. 
4. Bring to the boil, stirring every so often to help dissolve the sugar.
5. Turn the heat to low, put the lid on the pot and cook until the rice caramelises on the bottom, about 20 minutes. If you want more caramelisation, you can cook for up to 35 minutes.
6. Using a wooden spoon, scrape up the caramel bits on the bottom of the pot. Add the water, remaining coconut cream, and bring to the boil again over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to low, place the lid back on, and cook until the rice has absorbed all the liquid and is soft and fluffy, about 15-20 minutes.
7. Fluff with a fork before serving, and if you want to, garnish with your preferred chopped fresh herbs.
