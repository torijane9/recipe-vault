### Swiss Meringue-Style Toasted Marshmallow Frosting 

### Ingredients
#ingredients 
- [ ] 5 large egg whites (approx 150g or 3/4 cup)
- [ ] 1 1/4 cup (250g) granulated sugar
- [ ] Pinch of cream of tartar
- [ ] 1 tsp vanilla extract
- [ ] 200g (approx one standard jar) marshmallow fluff/marshmallow creme
---
#### Instructions
1. In a heatproof bowl (preferably the bowl of your stand mixer, if using), combine the egg whites, granulated sugar, and cream of tartar.
2. Set the bowl over a saucepan of gently simmering water (a bain-marie), ensuring the bottom of the bowl does not touch the water. Whisk constantly until the sugar has completely dissolved and the mixture is hot to the touch (around 70°C on a thermometer, or until you can’t feel any sugar granules when you rub a little of the mixture between your fingers).
3. Remove the bowl from the heat. Using an electric mixer (with the whisk attachment if using a stand mixer), beat the egg white mixture on high speed until it forms stiff, glossy peaks and the outside of the bowl feels cool to the touch (this can take 7-10 minutes).
4. Add the vanilla extract and beat to combine.
5. Gently fold in the marshmallow fluff until just combined and the frosting is smooth and billowy. Be careful not to overmix and deflate it. Use immediately.
