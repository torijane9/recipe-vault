### Instructions
1. Carefully remove the stems and as many seeds as possible from the chilli peppers. You can gently tear them open to make this easier. Don’t worry about getting every single seed, just most of them.
2. Heat a large, dry frying pan or griddle over a medium heat. Add the deseeded chillies and toast them for about 30 seconds to 1 minute per side, turning frequently. You are looking for a fragrant aroma and a slight darkening of their colour, but be very careful not to burn them, as burn chillies will make your sauce bitter.
3. Once toasted, transfer the chillies to a heatproof bowl. Pour the hot water over them, ensuring they are fully submerged. Place a plate or smaller lid on top to keep them immersed. Let them soak for at least 20-30 minutes, or until they are soft and pliable.  
4. While the chillies are soaking, heat the oil in a separate pan over a medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook for 5-7 minutes until softened and translucent. Add the garlic cloves and chopped tomato and continue to cook for another 3-4 minutes until fragrant. Take the pan off the heat.
5. Once the chillies are soft, transfer them and the soaking liquid to a blender. Add the onion, garlic, and tomato mix to the blender as well, followed by all the dry spices, apple cider vinegar, and salt.
6. Bland on high speed for several minutes until the mixture is incredibly smooth and uniform. This can take about 3-5 minutes, and you might need to stop and scrape down the sides of the blender a few times to ensure everything is incorporated. The goal here is a silky, lump-free paste.
7. (Not compulsory but recommended) Place a fine-mesh sieve over a large bowl. Pour the blended chilli mixture through the sieve, using the back of a ladle or a spoon to press down on the solids and force as much liquid through as possible. Discard the remaining pulp and chilli skins left in the sieve. This straining process removes any fibrous bits, ensuring the braising liquid and subsequent consommé are extra smooth.

#### Notes
- Soaking the chillies is an important step to ensure the final blend is smooth.
- This can be used to marinate meat, or with added liquid it can be used to braise large cuts of meat for birria tacos!
