---
#### Instructions
1. If using a stand mixer, attach your bread hook. Add the water to the bowl first, followed by flour. Mix on low setting until flour and water are just combined. If using your hand, add water followed by flour into a medium sized mixing bowl. Using your hand to pinch the flour and water together until just combined.
2. Cover bowl with plastic wrap or a damp kitchen towel. Allow to rest for 30 minutes. This allows the dough to fully hydrate before adding in the salt and creates to a better texture.
3. Remove cover and sprinkle in salt and yeast together. If using a stand mixer, mix for 3 minutes on medium speed, or until the dough is fully combined. If using your hand, this will take closer to 5 minutes to thoroughly mix. Make sure that there aren’t pockets of unincorporated salt and yeast. Remove the dough from the bowl with a bowl scraper and drizzle olive oil into the bottom of the bowl. Return the dough to the bowl or an oiled rectangular baking dish.
4. You should proof the dough in a vessel that is the same shape as your baking dish. So, if you plan to bake in a rectangular baking sheet, you should allow it to proof in a rectangular dish like a casserole dish. If you are going to bake the focaccia in a round cast iron pan, you should allow it to proof in a bowl. This will make it easier for the dough to fill the baking vessel.
5. Fold the dough into thirds like a letter and then flip the dough fold-side down. Cover with plastic wrap or damp kitchen towel and allow to rest on the counter for 20 minutes.
6. After 20 minutes fold into thirds again and turn the dough fold-side down. Replace the cover and allow the dough to rest for 20 minutes. Repeat this two more times, for a total of 60 minutes and 4 folds, before putting the dough in the refrigerator over night to retard.
	- The process will go like this:
		- fold into thirds and cover
		- let sit 20 minutes
		- fold into thirds and cover
		- let sit 20 minutes
		- fold into thirds and cover
		- let sit 20 minutes
		- fold into thirds final time and cover. Place dough, completely covered, in the refrigerator over night.
7. The next day, take your dough out of the refrigerator. Choose your baking vessel and coat generously with olive oil. This amount of dough works well for a round 10” or an 8”x12” rectangular vessel. However, you could also divide the dough into two of the same sized vessels for a thinner focaccia. Whatever vessel you choose, oil generously before adding your dough. Dimple the dough to spread it out as much as possible. Drizzle with more olive oil and cover once again. Allow to proof one last time on the counter for 45-60 minutes. The amount of time will depend on the temperature of the room. However, you will know it’s ready when the dough looks light and fluffy.
8. Preheat the oven to 425**°**F (on convection bake, if possible) and place a rack in the center.
9. When the dough seems ready to bake, dimple the surface by lightly pressing your fingertips into it, spreading your fingers out as you press down. More bubbles should form as you do this. Top with whatever toppings you’d like or simply with flaky salt like Malden. Drizzle, yet again, with olive oil and it’s ready to go in the oven. Bake for 20 minutes and check the bread to see if it is browning unevenly. Rotate it and bake again for another 15 minutes. It should bake for about 35-45 minutes depending on your oven. Allow to cool slightly before slicing and serving.
