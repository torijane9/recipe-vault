#### Instructions
1. In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over low heat. Once melted, remove from the heat and allow to cool for 5-10 minutes. It should be liquid but not piping hot. Alternatively, melt in the microwave in short bursts.
2. Pour the slightly cooled melted butter into a large mixing bowl. Add the packed dark brown sugar and granulated sugar. Whisk thoroughly for about 1-2 minutes until well combined and the sugars are somewhat dissolved into the butter. The mixture should look glossy.
3. Add the whole egg, egg yolk, and vanilla extract to the butter-sugar mixture. Whisk again until everything is fully incorporated and the mixture is smooth and slightly aerated.
4. In a separate medium bowl, whisk together the plain flour, cornflour, bicarbonate of soda, and fine sea salt. This ensures the leavening agent and salt are evenly distributed.
5. Gradually add the dry ingredient mixture to the wet ingredient mixture. Using a spatula or wooden spoon, fold the ingredients together until *just* combined. Be careful not to overmix at this stage; a few streaks of flour remaining are okay. The dough will be soft and may appear slightly greasy – this is normal.
6. Cover the bowl tightly with cling film (plastic wrap), pressing it gently against the surface of the dough to prevent a skin from forming. Refrigerate for a minimum of 2 hours. For best flavour and texture development (and easier handling), chill for 24 hours, or up to 72 hours.
7. When ready to bake, preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F) conventional / 160°C fan. Line two large baking trays with parchment paper.
8. Remove the chilled dough from the refrigerator. It will be firm. Using a large ice cream scoop (approximately 3-4 tablespoons / 50-60ml capacity, yielding dough balls of 90-100g), scoop out portions of dough. You can roll them briefly between your hands to smooth them if desired, but a slightly craggy, scooped look is also great.
9. Place the dough balls onto the prepared baking trays, ensuring they are well spaced apart (e.g., 4-5 per large tray) as they will spread. Do not flatten them.
10. Bake for 12-16 minutes. The exact time will depend on your oven and the size of your cookies. They are ready when the edges are golden brown and set, and the tops are slightly puffed and mostly set, but the very centre might still look a little soft or underdone. This "just underdone" centre contributes to the final gooey texture.
11. Remove the baking trays from the oven. Let the cookies cool on the baking trays for 10-15 minutes. During this time, they will firm up and continue to cook slightly from the residual heat.
12. Carefully transfer the cookies to a wire rack to cool completely. They will be delicate while warm.
