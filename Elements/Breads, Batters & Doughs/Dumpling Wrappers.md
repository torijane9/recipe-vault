### Dumpling Wrappers 

### Ingredients
#ingredients 
- [ ] 250g plain flour, plus extra for dusting
- [ ] 130ml very hot but not boiling water

#### Instructions
Prepare the Dough:
1. Place the plain flour in a large mixing bowl. 
2. Gradually pour in the very hot water, stirring continuously with chopsticks or a wooden spoon. 
3. Once the water is mostly incorporated, and the mixture looks shaggy and crumbly, turn it out onto a clean, lightly floured work surface.
Knead the Dough:
4. Carefully knead the dough with your hands for about 5-8 minutes. It might be a little warm at first, but it will cool quickly as you work.
5. Initially, it will be quite stiff and lumpy, but as you knead, it will gradually become smooth, elastic, and less sticky. The dough should feel soft and uniform. If it’s too sticky, add a tiny pinch more flour; if it’s too dry, wet your hands slightly and continue kneading.
Rest the Dough:
6. Form the kneaded bowl into a ball.
7. Place it back in the mixing bowl, cover it with a damp cloth or glad wrap, and let it rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes. This resting period is crucial as it allows the gluten to relax, making the dough much easier to roll out thinly.
Prepare for Rolling:
8. Once rested, remove the dough from the bowl. Knead lightly to ensure it’s smooth.
Method 1 - Rolling and Cutting:
- Divide the dough into two equal portions. Keep one portion covered with the damp cloth while you work with the other.
- On a lightly floured surface, roll out one portion of dough into a very thin sheet, about 1-2mm thick. Aim for an even thickness throughout. The thinner you can get it, the more delicate your wrappers will be.
- Using a round cookie cutter or the rim of a drinking glass, cut out as many circles as possible. Re-roll the scraps once and cut out more circles, then discard any remaining small pieces.
Method 2 - Individual Rolling (for a more traditional, authentic feel):
- Roll the dough into a long, even log, about 2-3cm in diameter. 
- Using a sharp knife, cut the log into 30-40 equal pieces (about 8-10g each). 
- Take one piece of dough, flatten it slightly with your palm, and lightly dust both sides with flour.
- Using a small rolling pin, roll it out into a circle about 7-8cm in diameter. The traditional technique involves rolling the dough with one hand while rotating it with the other, making the edges slightly thinner than the centre - this helps in pleating. If this is too tricky, just aim for an evenly thin circle.
- As you roll, keep your work surface lightly floured to prevent sticking.
Storing the Wrappers:
- As you finish rolling each wrapper, place it on a lightly floured tray or plate. Ensure they don’t stick to each other by dusting them lightly with flour or placing small squares of greaseproof paper between them if you’re stacking. 
- Keep the finished wrappers covered with a damp cloth to prevent them from drying out while you’re rolling, or while you’re assembling dumplings.
