#### Instructions
Prepare the Dough:
1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt.
2. Gradually pour in the boiling water, mixing with chopsticks or a wooden spoon until shaggy clumps form. The hot water helps to create a softer, more pliable dough.
3. Now, slowly add the cold water, continuing to mix until a rough dough comes together.
4. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 8-10 minutes until it’s smooth, elastic, and no longer sticky. It should feel lovely and supple.
5. Place the dough back in the bowl, cover it with a damp cloth or cling film, and let it rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes. This resting period is crucial for relaxing the gluten, making the dough much easier to roll out thinly.
Prepare the Spring Onion Oil Mixture: 
6. While the dough is resting, prepare your spring onion mixture. In a small bowl, combine the finely chopped spring onions, sesame oil, the 3 tablespoons of neutral oil, ½ teaspoon salt, and ¼ teaspoon white pepper. Mix well. This seasoned oil is what gives the pancakes their incredible flavour and helps create those beautiful layers.
Shape the Pancakes: 
7. Once rested, divide the dough into 4-6 equal portions (depending on how large you want your pancakes).
8. On a lightly floured surface, take one portion of dough and roll it out into a very thin rectangle, roughly 20x30 cm (8x12 inches) – the thinner, the flakier your pancake will be!
9. Brush the entire surface of the rolled-out dough generously with the spring onion oil mixture. Make sure you get right to the edges.
10. Starting from one of the longer sides, tightly roll the rectangle into a log. The tighter you roll it, the more distinct the layers will be.
11. Take the log and coil it into a spiral, like a snail shell. Tuck the end underneath.
12. Gently flatten the spiral with your palm.
13. Using a rolling pin, carefully roll the flattened spiral out into a round pancake, about 15-20 cm (6-8 inches) in diameter and about 3-4 mm (⅛ inch) thick. Don't roll it too thin at this stage, or you might lose some of the layers.
14. Repeat with the remaining dough portions.
Cook the Pancakes: 
15. Heat a large frying pan or griddle over medium heat. Add a tablespoon or so of neutral oil to coat the bottom.
16. Once the oil is hot, carefully place one pancake into the pan. Cook for 3-5 minutes per side, or until golden brown and crispy, with those lovely flaky layers starting to separate. You might need to adjust the heat to prevent burning.
17. Press down gently on the pancake with a spatula occasionally to ensure even cooking and encourage crispiness.
18. Remove the cooked pancake from the pan and place it on a wire rack to keep it crisp while you cook the others. If you give it a gentle clap between your hands (once it’s slightly cooled), it can help separate those layers even more!
19. Repeat with the remaining pancakes, adding a little more oil to the pan as needed.

#### Notes:
- Serve these spring onion pancakes hot and fresh! They are fantastic on their own, or you can serve them with a dipping sauce.
