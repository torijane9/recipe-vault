#### Instructions
1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour and icing sugar.
2. Add the cold, cubed butter. Using your fingertips, rub the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles fine breadcrumbs. Try to work quickly so the butter doesn’t get too warm.
3. In a small bowl, which the egg yolk with 2 Tbsp of cold water. Add this mixture to the flour and butter.
4. Bring the dough together gently with your hands until it forms a ball. If it’s too dry, add the remaining Tbsp of cold water, a tiny bit at a time, until it just comes together. Be careful not to overwork the dough, or it will become tough.
5. Flatten the dough (into a disc or square depending on what you’re using it for), wrap it in glad wrap, and chill in the fridge for at least 30 minutes (or up to 2 days) before rolling out to use. This is crucial for a tender pastry.
