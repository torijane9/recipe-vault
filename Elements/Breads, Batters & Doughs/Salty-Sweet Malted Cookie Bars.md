#### Instructions
1.  **Prepare Baking Tin:** Preheat your oven to 180°C (160°C fan / 350°F / Gas Mark 4). Line your 20cm x 20cm (8-inch x 8-inch) square baking tin with baking parchment, leaving an overhang on two sides to easily lift the bars out later.
2.  **Cream Butter and Sugars:** In a large bowl, using an electric mixer, cream together the softened unsalted butter, caster sugar, and light brown sugar until light and fluffy, about 2-3 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.
3.  **Add Wet Ingredients:** Beat in the egg, then the egg yolk, and finally the vanilla extract. Mix until well combined, scraping the bowl again. The mixture might look a little curdled, but don't worry, it'll come together when you add the dry ingredients.
4.  **Combine Dry Ingredients:** In a separate medium bowl, whisk together the plain flour, malted milk powder, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda, and the ¾ tsp of sea salt flakes.
5.  **Combine Wet and Dry:** Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing on a low speed until just combined. Be careful not to overmix – overmixing can lead to tough cookies. The dough will be thick and soft.
6.  **Chill (Optional but Recommended):** If you have time, cover the bowl with cling film and refrigerate the dough for at least 30 minutes. This helps the flavours meld, prevents spreading too much, and results in a chewier texture.
7.  **Press into Tin:** Press the cookie dough evenly into the prepared baking tin. Use the back of a spoon or your hands (lightly floured if sticky) to get an even layer.
8.  **Sprinkle with Salt:** Lightly sprinkle some additional sea salt flakes over the top of the cookie dough – this enhances the salty-sweet profile.
9.  **Bake:** Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown and set, but the centre still looks slightly soft and gooey. Remember, a slightly underbaked cookie bar is a chewy cookie bar!
10. **Cool and Slice:** Remove from the oven and let the cookie bars cool completely in the tin on a wire rack. Cooling is crucial for them to firm up and for achieving that perfect chewy texture. Once completely cool, use the parchment overhang to lift the slab out of the tin. Slice into rectangular "dipping bars" of your desired size (e.g., 2.5cm x 7.5cm / 1 inch x 3 inches).

#### Notes:
- Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3-4 days. They might lose a tiny bit of chewiness, but will still be delicious!
