#### Instructions
1. Heat 1-2 tablespoons of oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion and a small pinch of salt .
2. Cook, while frequently stirring, until the onions are slightly caramelized. Transfer cooked onion to a large mixing bowl and rest for 5 minutes, before adding the ground chicken.
3. Place ground chicken , olive oil , oregano , cumin , onion powder , turmeric , cayenne , pepper , garlic , and feta in the large mixing bowl with the onion.
4. Stir until everything is well combined (Note: The more you stir/work the ground meat after everything is combined, the more bouncy your meatballs will be - the less you stir, the more crumbly they will be, so mix as much or as little depending on your preference of fi nal meatball texture).
5. Preheat your oven to 375ºF (204ºC).
6. Lightly grease a baking sheet and set aside. Using a large spoon or cookie scooper scoop out 2-inch rounds of meat and roll into balls. Place on the lightly greased baking sheet.
7. In a large skillet on high heat, add neutral oil. Once the oil is shimmering and hot, add the meatballs.
8. Cook each side until golden brown (around 2-3 minutes per side).
9. Place back on the greased baking sheet and fi nish cooking in the oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the center of the meatball reads 165ºF, using a meat thermometer.
