#### Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 160°C.
2. Heat the olive oil in a heavy-bottomed pan over medium to medium-high heat. Brown the boneless short ribs in the oil. Do not use the lid while browning the meat, you are not cooking the meat through, you just want to get a nice crust on all sides.
3. While the ribs are browning, prepare the marinade. In a bowl, combine the soy sauce, brown sugar, garlic, ginger, chilli, white vinegar, chilli paste, water, salt, and pepper. Set aside.
4. Once the ribs are browned, pour the marinate over them and top with the chopped spring onions. Place the lid on the pan and braise the ribs in the oven for 2.5 to 3 hours.
