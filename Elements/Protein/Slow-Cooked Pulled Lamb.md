#### Instructions
1.  **Prep the Lamb:** If your lamb shoulder has a thick layer of fat, you can trim some of it, but leave a decent amount as it adds flavour and keeps the lamb moist during cooking. Pat the lamb dry all over with kitchen paper. This helps with browning. Season the lamb generously all over with the salt and a good grinding of black pepper.
2.  **Sear the Lamb:** Heat the olive oil in a large, heavy-based, oven-proof pot or Dutch oven (that has a lid) over a medium-high heat. Once hot, carefully place the lamb shoulder into the pot and sear it on all sides until deeply browned. This step is crucial for building flavour – don't rush it! Once browned, remove the lamb from the pot and set it aside.
3.  **Sauté the Aromatics:** Reduce the heat to medium. Add the chopped onions to the same pot, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom (those are flavour!). Sauté the onions for 5-7 minutes until they start to soften and turn translucent.
4.  **Add Spices and Ginger:** Add the smashed garlic, sliced ginger (if using), cinnamon stick, crushed cardamom pods, cumin seeds, coriander seeds, and black peppercorns to the pot with the onions. Stir and cook for another 1-2 minutes until the spices become fragrant. Be careful not to burn them.
5.  **Build the Liquid Base:** Stir in the tomato purée and cook for another minute. Then, pour in the lamb or chicken stock, water, and date syrup (or honey) if using. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer, scraping the bottom of the pot to loosen any remaining stuck-on bits.
6.  **Return the Lamb:** Carefully return the seared lamb shoulder to the pot. It should be partially submerged in the liquid. If it's not, add a little more stock or water until it is.
7.  **Slow Cook:** Cover the pot tightly with its lid. You have a few options for cooking:
    *   **Oven Method (Recommended):** Transfer the pot to a preheated oven at 150°C (300°F / Gas Mark 2). Cook for at least 3.5 to 4.5 hours, or until the lamb is incredibly tender and easily pulls apart with two forks. For a larger or bone-in shoulder, it might take up to 5-6 hours. Check it after 3 hours and then every 30 minutes, turning the lamb over halfway through cooking if possible to ensure even moisture.
    *   **Hob Method:** If you don't have an oven-proof pot, you can slow cook on the hob. Keep the heat very low – just barely simmering – and ensure the lid is on tightly. You'll need to monitor the liquid levels more closely and top up with a little hot water if it gets too low. This method can sometimes be less even than the oven.
    *   **Slow Cooker Method:** If using a slow cooker, follow steps 1-5 in your pan on the hob. Then, transfer the sautéed aromatics and liquid to your slow cooker. Place the seared lamb shoulder in. Cook on LOW for 6-8 hours or on HIGH for 3-4 hours, until fork-tender.
8.  **Rest and Pull:** Once the lamb is cooked and incredibly tender, carefully remove it from the pot and transfer it to a large carving board or a shallow dish. Cover it loosely with foil and let it rest for 15-20 minutes. This resting period is vital for juicy, tender meat.
9.  **Shred the Lamb:** While the lamb is resting, you can skim any excess fat from the cooking liquid in the pot if desired. Then, using two forks, shred the lamb meat apart. It should literally fall away from the bone (if bone-in) and pull into tender strands.
10. **Combine and Serve:** Return the shredded lamb to the pot with the cooking liquid. Stir it all together, ensuring the lamb is coated in the delicious, aromatic juices. Taste and adjust seasoning if needed – you might want a little more salt or pepper.
11. You can use it straight away in your pilaf, or store it in an airtight container with some of its cooking liquid for up to 3-4 days in the fridge, or freeze it for longer storage.
#### Notes:
- If cooking in an Instant Pot or pressure cooker, follow the initial instruction steps in the ‘Sauté’ function, then switch to ‘Pressure Cook’. 
- Estimated pressure cooking time:
	- 1.5kg boneless lamb shoulder: 60-70 minutes on high pressure
	- 2kg bone-in lamb shoulder: 75-90 minutes on high pressure.
- You’ll want to follow it with a natural pressure release. This is crucial for tender meat as it allows the muscle fibres to relax slowly, reabsorbing the juices, resulting in much more succulent lamb. Don’t be temped to quick release!

- There are so many uses for this! It can be added to a jewelled rice, wraps, salad, or loaded flat breads. It could even be used as a delicious topping for a homemade hummus.
 **Tips for Success:**
*   **Bone-In vs. Boneless:** While boneless is easier to handle, bone-in lamb shoulder often imparts a richer, deeper flavour. Don't be afraid of the bone; it comes out easily once cooked.
*   **Don't Rush the Sear:** That initial browning creates layers of flavour that you can't get any other way.
*   **Taste the Liquid:** Before serving, always taste the cooking liquid. It's packed with flavour and will help moisten your pulled lamb.
*   **Freezing:** This lamb freezes beautifully! Portion it out with some of the cooking liquid before freezing. Thaw in the fridge overnight before reheating gently on the hob or in the microwave.
