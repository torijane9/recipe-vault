## Birria Beef

### Ingredients
- [ ] [[Birria Braising Sauce Base]]
- [ ] Approx 1.5-1.8kg beef chuck
- [ ] 700g - 1kg beef short ribs 
- [ ] Approx 1-1.5 litres (4-6 cups) Beef Stock or Water (or a combination)
---
### Instructions
1. Heat a large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven and brown the meat on all sides.
2. Add the birria braising sauce base over the meat, and add enough beef stock or water (or both) to just about cover the meat. You will need to adjust for the size of the pot.
3. Bring the liquid to a gentle simmer, then cover the pot and either continue to simmer on a very low heat on the hob for 3-4 hours, or transfer it to a preheated oven at 150°C for 3-5 hours, or until the meat is incredibly tender and easily pulls apart with a fork.
