### Instructions
1. Place the coriander seeds, cumin seeds, and optional caraway seeds in a small, dry frying pan. Toast over a medium-low heat for 2-3 minutes, shaking the pan frequently, until fragrant. Be careful not to burn them. Transfer to a mortar and pestle or a spice grinder and grind until finely crushed.
2. If you prefer less heat, slice open the green chillies and remove some or all of the seeds and white membranes. For a more smoky flavour (and if you're feeling adventurous!), you can char the chillies briefly over an open gas flame or under a grill/broiler until the skins are blackened, then peel them. This step is optional but adds depth. Roughly chop the prepared chillies.
3. In a food processor or a high-speed blender, combine the chopped green chillies, fresh coriander, fresh parsley, peeled garlic cloves, ground toasted spices, sea salt, and lemon juice.
4. With the food processor running, slowly drizzle in the 60ml (¼ cup) of extra virgin olive oil until a coarse, vibrant green paste forms. Scrape down the sides as needed. If the paste is too thick or not blending smoothly, add the additional olive oil a tablespoon at a time until you reach your desired consistency. It should be thick but spoonable.
5. Taste the paste and adjust seasoning as necessary. You might want more salt, a little more lemon juice for brightness, or even a pinch of sugar to balance the heat if your chillies are particularly fiery.
6. Transfer the green harissa paste to a clean, airtight jar. Pour a thin layer of extra virgin olive oil over the surface of the paste to create a seal, which helps with preservation and keeps its vibrant colour.

#### Notes
- The heat of your paste will largely depend on the type of green chillies you use and whether you remove their seeds. Taste a small piece of chilli beforehand to gauge its intensity.
- Stored in an airtight jar in the refrigerator with a layer of olive oil on top, it’ll keep well for up to 2-3 weeks.
- For longer storage, you can freeze portions of the paste in ice cube trays. Once frozen, transfer the cubes to a freezer-safe bag for up to 3 months. Thaw as needed.
- Use this paste to marinate chicken or fish, stir into plain yoghurt for a dip, add to scrambled eggs, spread on toast with avocado, or mix into dressings and sauces.
