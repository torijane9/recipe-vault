### Instructions
1. Place the dried red chillies in a heatproof bowl. Pour enough boiling water over them to fully submerge them. Place a plate on top to keep them submerged. Let them soak for at least 30 minutes, or until very soft and pliable. Drain the chillies, reserving about 60ml (¼ cup) of the soaking liquid.
2. While the chillies are soaking, place the coriander seeds, cumin seeds, and caraway seeds in a small, dry frying pan. Toast over a medium-low heat for 3-4 minutes, shaking the pan frequently, until fragrant. Be careful not to burn them. Transfer to a mortar and pestle or a spice grinder and grind until finely crushed.
3. If you're roasting your own red capsicum, preheat your grill/broiler to high. Place the whole red capsicum on a baking tray and grill/broil, turning occasionally, until the skin is completely blackened and blistered all over. Transfer to a bowl, cover with cling film, and let steam for 10-15 minutes. Once cool enough to handle, peel away the skin, remove the stem and seeds, and roughly chop the flesh.
4. In a food processor or a high-speed blender, combine the drained rehydrated chillies, peeled garlic cloves, ground toasted spices, roasted red capsicum, sea salt, lemon juice, and optional tomato paste.
5. With the food processor running, slowly drizzle in the 100ml (⅓ cup) of extra virgin olive oil. If the paste is too thick or not blending smoothly, add the reserved chilli soaking liquid (or fresh water) a tablespoon at a time until a thick, smooth, and spreadable paste forms. You might not need all of the liquid.
6. Taste the harissa paste and adjust seasoning as necessary. You might want more salt, a little more lemon juice for brightness, or even a tiny pinch of sugar to balance the heat.
7. Transfer the harissa paste to a clean, airtight jar. Pour a thin layer of extra virgin olive oil over the surface of the paste to create a seal. This helps prevent spoilage and keeps it fresh.

#### Notes
- To control the heat, you can adjust the type and quantity of chillies. Removing the seeds from the dried chillies will also reduce the heat significantly.
- Stored in an airtight jar in the refrigerator with an olive oil seal, Classic Red Harissa Paste will keep well for up to 3-4 weeks.
- For longer storage, freeze portions in ice cube trays. Once frozen, transfer the cubes to a freezer-safe bag for up to 3 months. Thaw as needed.
- Use harissa as a marinade for lamb or chicken, stir into couscous or rice, add to soups and stews for depth, mix into hummus, or simply spread on crusty bread.
