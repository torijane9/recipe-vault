#### Instructions
1. In a large mixing bowl, combine all of the ingredients together.
2. Thoroughly mix all the ingredients together vigorously for 3-5 minutes. The goal is to fully combine everything and develop a slightly sticky texture in the mince. This helps bind the filling and gives it a better texture when cooked.
