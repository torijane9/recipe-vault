#### Instructions
1. Soften Cream Cheese: Ensure your cream cheese is at room temperature. Place it in a medium mixing bowl. This step is super important for a smooth, lump-free schmear.
2. Prepare Add-ins: Drain the capers well and give them a rough chop. Finely chop the fresh dill and chives. Grate the zest from the lemon, being careful to only get the yellow part and none of the bitter white pith. Juice the lemon.
3. Combine ingredients: Add the chopped capers, lemon zest, lemon juice, dill, and chives to the softened cream cheese in the bowl.
4. Mix thoroughly: Using a silicone spatula or wooden spoon, gently fold and mix all the ingredients together. Mix until everything is evenly combined, ensuring the capers and herbs are well distributed throughout the cream cheese. You don’t want to overmix to the point of breaking down the capers too much, but you want a cohesive spread.
5. Taste & Season: Taste the spread. The capers are quite salty, and the lemon adds tang, so you may not need much/any additional salt. Add a pinch of sea salt if you feel it needs it. Season generously with freshly ground black pepper. Adjust lemon juice to your preference for tang.
6. Transfer the schmear to an airtight container. Cover tightly and chill in the fridge for at least 30 minutes before serving. This allows the flavours to meld and develop, and firm up to a perfect spreading consistency.

#### Notes:
- This will keep well in the fridge for up to 5-7 days. 
- Fresh herbs are key: Using fresh dill is a game-changer, and chives add another layer of delicate oniony freshness.
- The goal is the balance the richness of the cream cheese with the acidity from the lemon and the brininess of the capers. Don’t be shy with the lemon zest - it provides a wonderful aromatic lift without making the schmear too liquid.
