#### Instructions
1.  **Prepare the Duck:** If you're roasting your own duck, allow it to cool enough to handle, then shred the meat from the bones and finely chop it. If using pre-cooked duck, shred or chop it as needed. If you have crispy duck skin, chop that finely too and set aside to mix in at the end for extra texture and flavour.
2.  **Sauté Aromatics:** Heat the cooking oil in a wok or large frying pan over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and grated ginger and stir-fry for about 30 seconds until fragrant, being careful not to burn them.
3.  **Cook the Filling:** Add the shredded duck to the pan and stir-fry for 2-3 minutes to heat through and get a little colour.
4.  **Add Sauces and Seasonings:** Stir in the hoisin sauce, soy sauce, sesame oil, rice vinegar, and the Chinese five-spice powder. Mix well to ensure the duck is thoroughly coated. Cook for another 2-3 minutes, allowing the sauce to thicken slightly and meld with the duck.
5.  **Incorporate Vegetables:** Add the finely sliced spring onions. Stir-fry for another minute until the spring onions are just wilted.
6.  **Thicken (if needed):** If the filling looks a little too loose (it should be moist but not overly wet), stir in the cornflour slurry and cook for another minute, stirring constantly, until the sauce thickens and clings to the duck mixture. The ideal consistency should be scoopable and hold its shape reasonably well.
7.  **Cool:** Remove from the heat and transfer the filling to a bowl. If you have crispy duck skin, stir it through now. Allow the filling to cool completely before using it.

#### Notes:
- It is important to let the filling cool before using to fill dumplings or bao buns, because hot filling can make wrappers tear or become soggy.
