### Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 180 c. Heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium-high heat. Brown the beef in batches for 3-4 minutes. Remove the beef from the pan and place it in a casserole dish.
2. Add the onion and garlic to the pan and cook the mixture for 2 minutes, or until they are golden. Add the onion and garlic to the casserole dish with the chipotle sauce, cumin, oregano, coriander, tomatoes, and beef stock.
3. Press a piece of baking paper onto the surface of the meat and liquid and cover the casserole dish with a lid. Bake the casserole in the preheated oven for 1 1/2 hours. Add the beans and cook the casserole for a further 30 minutes until the beef is tender, stirring it occasionally. 
4. Stir through the coriander and serve the beef with rice or baked potatoes, sour cream, and a tomato and avocado salad.
