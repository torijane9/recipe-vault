### Coconut Rice 

### Ingredients

---
#### Instructions
1. Rinse rice several times until the water runs clear - usually about 3 times - then drain the water out. Set aside.
2. Add sugar and salt to a measuring jug. Add boiling water to reach the 1 cup mark, then carefully stir to dissolve the sugar completely. Let cool slightly.
3. If using a rice cooker: With washed rice in your rice cooker bowl, add coconut milk, then warm sugar water mixture. Add enough room temperature water to reach the 3 cup mark on the rice cooker bowl.
4. Cook rice using the standard setting. Once the rice is done, fluff up the rice, then close the lid of the rice cooker again and let sit for 30 minutes on the warm setting. Fluff once more and enjoy.
5. If cooking on the stovetop: Add washed rice and coconut milk to pot, then add sugar water mixture. Finally, add 1 1/3 cups cool water to the pot.
6. Bring the rice to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to a low simmer. Cover with a lid and simmer for another 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, turn the heat off and let the rice sit, covered, for 15 minutes. Fluff the rice at this point, then return the lid and let sit for another 15-20 minutes. Enjoy!

#### Notes:
- Try and get a coconut milk that doesn’t have any other additives!
