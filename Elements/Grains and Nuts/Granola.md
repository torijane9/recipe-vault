#### Instructions
1.  Microwave coconut oil in a measuring jug until it is just liquid, then add honey and mix to combine. 
2. Put the oats in a large bowl and pour the oil/honey mixture over top. Stir well, making sure that the oats are all covered in the wet mixture. If using, you can stir in a pinch of sea salt here.
3. Place a sheet of baking paper in the base of a large roasting dish, and spread the oats out in one layer. If you like clusters in your granola, you can clump some of the mixture together to vary the texture and form clusters. 
4. Bake at (???) degrees Celsius for (???) minutes, keeping an eye on it to ensure it doesn’t burn. Toss the mixture around every couple of minutes to ensure it is evenly toasted.
5. When the oats are toasted to your liking, remove from the oven and allow to cool completely. Once cool, add the oats back into a large bowl that is big enough to combine all the ingredients in.
6. Add the rest of the ingredients and mix well, ensuring everything is thoroughly combined.
7. Store in an airtight container.
