## Flavoured Mayonnaises
When making flavoured mayonnaise, there’s a simple guiding principle to follow: 
- **Add ingredients BEFORE blending if you want them to become a smooth, fully-integrated part of the mayonnaise itself.** 
	- This works best for ingredients that can be pureed and won’t throw off the oil-to-water ratio needed for the emulsion.
	- The immersion blender completely pulverises them, so their flavour becomes the foundational base of the mayonnaise.
- **Add ingredients AFTER blending if you want to preserve their texture, of they are already in a paste/liquid form that can be easily stirred into the mayonnaise.**
	- This is the safest method, and probably the best one to use most often.
	- This method preserves the texture of the ingredients. You get distinct pieces, flecks, and crunches. It's also the only way to add things that are already a sauce or paste without risking splitting the emulsion
### Ingredients to add BEFORE blending:
In the [[Mayonnaise From Scratch]] recipe, these ingredients are added with the egg, lemon juice, and salt at the beginning, and blitzed together with the oil. 
- [ ] Garlic cloves.
- [ ] Fresh, robust herbs
	- [ ] Basil
	- [ ] Coriander
	- [ ] Parsley
- [ ] Roasted red capsicum
- [ ] Sun-dried tomatoes
- [ ] Anchovy fillets
- [ ] Grated ginger
### Ingredients to add AFTER blending:
After blending the [[Mayonnaise From Scratch]] recipe together, these ingredients are gently folded or stirred into the finished mayonnaise.
- [ ] Chopped pickled ingredients
	- [ ] Gherkins
	- [ ] Capers
	- [ ] Pickled onions
	- [ ] Chopped olives
	- [ ] Pickled jalapenos
- [ ] Finely chopped fresh herbs. 
	- [ ] Dill
	- [ ] Chives
	- [ ] Parsley
	- [ ] Tarragon
- [ ] Spices and powders  - these should stir in easily.
	- [ ] Paprika
	- [ ] Curry powder
	- [ ] Cayenne pepper
	- [ ] Black pepper
- [ ] Prepared pastes and sauces. These are already emulsified, or are thick enough to be folded in without breaking the mayonnaise.
	- [ ] Chipotle paste
	- [ ] Sriracha
	- [ ] Pesto
	- [ ] Harissa
	- [ ] Gochujang
- [ ] Finely chopped aromatics. Their crunchy texture would be lost if they were added before blending.
	- [ ] Shallots
	- [ ] Spring onions

Let them cool, then squeeze the soft cloves out of their skins and add them to the egg mixture.               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Coriander & Lime Mayonnaise          | A small handful of fresh coriander (leaves **and** stems).<br>The juice of 1 whole lime in place of the lemon juice in the mayonnaise recipe. | Add the whole coriander leaves and stems to the blender cup with the egg and lime juice instead of lemon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | The blender will do all the work of chopping the coriander finely.                                                                                                                                                                          |

This helps draw out its colour and flavour. <br>Scrape out and discard the soft pulp from the preserved lemon, rinse the rind well, chop it roughly, and add it to the blender cup along with the saffron-infused lemon juice and egg. | Wonderfully fragrant and sophisticated, with the bright, salty, uniquely floral tang of preserved lemon and the beautiful golden hue and subtle aroma of saffron.<br>It’s a showstopper with grilled fish, lamb, or used in a potato salad. |
For these recipes, make the base mayonnaise first, and then gently stir or fold these ingredients into the finished product.
