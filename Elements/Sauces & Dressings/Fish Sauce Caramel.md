#### Instructions
1. In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine the sugar, lemon juice, and half the water and bring to a boil. Using a wet pastry brush, wash down any sugar crystals on the side of the pan. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and let cook until the mixture is a deep amber colour, about 10 minutes. I recommend sticking by the pot and keeping a watchful eye on the caramel as it can quickly go from transparent to burnt. 
2. Stir in the shallots, chilli, star anise, cinnamon, ginger, garlic, and pepper. Remove the saucepan from the heat and carefully whisk in the fish sauce. Stir over a moderate heat until the fish sauce is dissolved. Pour the sauce into a heatproof bowl and let cool completely. Remove the chilli, star anise, and cinnamon stick. Use immediately or refrigerate.

3. in the meantime, thinly slice the ginger, peel and crush the garlic and thinly slice the shallot. add ginger, garlic, shallot, chili (if using fresh, split the chili before adding), star anise, cinnamon and black pepper to a bowl.
4. once the caramel is made, remove it from the heat and stir in the aromatics and fish sauce; it will bubble up so be careful. mix well to combine then let cool completely before sieving out the aromatics and storing in the fridge for at least one month; i’ve had caramels in the fridge that have lasted much longer.
