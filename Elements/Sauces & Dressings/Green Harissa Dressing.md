## Green Harissa Dressing

### Ingredients
- [ ] 4-5 green chillies, such as jalapeno or serrano
- [ ] 1/4 cup Greek yoghurt
- [ ] 1 1/2 tsp ground cumin
- [ ] 5 Tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
- [ ] 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
- [ ] 2 Tbsp lemon juice
- [ ] 1 tsp honey
- [ ] 1/2 tsp fine sea salt
- [ ] black pepper
---
### Instructions
1. If you have a gas range, turn burner to medium high. Using tongs, hold the green chillies one at a time over the open flame for about 60 seconds on each side until the skin is charred. Alternatively, you can also roast the chillies in the oven under the broiler for 3 to 5 minutes on each side until the skin is charred.
2. Let the chillies rest until they’re cool enough to handle, then use your fingers or a butter knife to roughly remove the skins and seeds from the chillies, discard these, then chop the chillies very finely with a knife.
3. In a medium-sized mixing bowl, combine the chopped chillies, Greek yoghurt, cumin, olive oil, garlic, lemon juice, honey, salt, and black pepper. 
4. If the consistency of the dressing seems too thick, you can add a Tablespoon or two of water to loosen it. Taste and adjust the seasoning with more salt or pepper if necessary.
