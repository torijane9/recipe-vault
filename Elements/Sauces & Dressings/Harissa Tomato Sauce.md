### Instructions
1. Heat the olive oil in a medium saucepan or pot over a medium heat. Add the finely chopped onion and cook gently for about 5-7 minutes, until softened and translucent but not browned.
2. Add the minced garlic, harissa paste, and smoked paprika to the pan. Cook for another 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly, until fragrant. This step really helps to bloom the spices and harissa, deepening their flavour.
3. Pour in the tinned chopped tomatoes, vegetable stock (or water), and tomato purée. Stir well to combine all the ingredients.
4. Bring the sauce to a gentle simmer. Reduce the heat to low, cover the pan partially, and let it cook for at least 15-20 minutes. This allows the flavours to meld beautifully and the sauce to thicken slightly. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.
5. After simmering, remove the lid and stir in the caster sugar and red wine vinegar (if using). Season generously with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed – you might want a little more sugar to cut through the acidity, or more salt to bring out the flavours. If you prefer a smoother sauce, you can use an immersion blender at this stage, or carefully transfer it to a regular blender and blend until desired consistency.
6. If serving as a dipping sauce, ladle into a serving bowl and sprinkle with freshly chopped coriander and parsley before serving.

#### Notes
- Harissa pastes vary wildly in heat! If you're unsure, start with 1 tablespoon and add more to taste during the simmering stage.
- For a dipping sauce, you want it fairly thick, but for a pizza sauce, a slightly looser consistency might be easier to spread. If it's too thick, add a splash more stock or water. If it's too thin, let it simmer uncovered for a bit longer to reduce.
- This sauce is absolutely fantastic made a day or two in advance as the flavours really develop. Store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 5 days. It also freezes brilliantly for up to 3 months – just thaw in the fridge overnight before reheating gently on the hob.
- **Variations:**
    - **Roasted Red Capsicum:** For an extra layer of sweetness and depth, you could blend in one roasted red capsicum (from a jar, drained) when you're blending the sauce.
    - **Lemon Zest:** A tiny amount of finely grated lemon zest added at the end can brighten up the whole sauce.
    - **Smoky Heat:** If you like things really smoky, a tiny pinch of chipotle powder could be added alongside the smoked paprika.
