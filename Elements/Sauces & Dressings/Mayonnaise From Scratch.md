## Mayonnaise From Scratch

### Ingredients
- [ ] 1 large egg, room temperature
- [ ] 15ml (1 Tbsp) lemon juice, about half a lemon
- [ ] Generous pinch of fine sea salt
- [ ] 240ml (1 cup) neutral-flavoured oil (e.g. sunflower, vegetable, canola, or light olive oil - avoid using extra virgin olive oil as its flavour is too strong)
Utensils:
- [ ] Immersion blender
- [ ] A tall, narrow jar or container that is just slightly wider than the head of the immersion blender. A wide-mouthed glass jar or the beaker that often comes with the immersion blender is perfect.

### Instructions
1. Place egg, lemon juice, salt, and any extra flavour ingredients in the bottom of cup or jar that just fits the head of your immersion blender. 
2. Pour oil on top of the egg mixture, and allow to settle for about 15 seconds. Don’t be tempted to stir it, you want to see the oil sitting cleanly on top of the other ingredients.
3. Put the immersion blender into the jar, and push it all the way down to the bottom of the container, so the head is flat on the base of the jar. Turn the blender on to high speed and hold it completely still. **Do not pulse or move the head.**
4. You should start to see the mayonnaise start to form at the bottom. Keep blending without moving the blender until the mayonnaise is combined about halfway up the oil.
5. Once the base is thick and emulsified, very slowly begin to tilt the blender head and lift it up through the remaining oil. This will gradually pull the rest of the oil into the mayonnaise, until all the oil is emulsified.
6. Once everything is combined, give it a final whizz, then taste. You might want to add another small pinch of salt or a tiny squeeze of lemon juice to get the flavour just right.
7. Transfer the mayonnaise to a clean jar with a lid, and store in the fridge for up to two weeks.

#### Notes
- How it works: 
	- A jar just wider than the head of the stick blender keeps the oil floating on top while the egg, water, and acid stay at the bottom. 
	- When the immersion blender starts, its blades mix the base ingredients directly and create a vortex that gradually pulls the oil down into the emulsion.
- This method makes it easier to add ingredients and adjust flavours without affecting the texture or emulsion.
- You need to make sure to use a cup or jar that just fits the head of the immersion blender, the close fit is what helps the emulsion to form properly. 
- Also, the egg/lemon juice mixture must be in contact with the blades before you turn it on for this method to work. If the mixture doesn’t reach the blades, double the recipe before attempting.
- The head of the blender must be firmly against the bottom of the jar until the mayonnaise starts to come together.
- If you can’t find a jar the right size, double the recipe in order to increase the starting volume of the egg/lemon mixture.
- It is important that the egg is at room temperature. A room temperature egg will emulsify much more easily, and create a more stable mayonnaise.
- The type of oil used will be a dominant flavour, which is why a neutral one is best for a classic mayonnaise.
