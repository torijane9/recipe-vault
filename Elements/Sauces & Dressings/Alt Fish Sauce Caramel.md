### Fish Sauce Caramel

### Ingredients
#ingredients 
- [ ] 400g (2 cups) granulated sugar
- [ ] 1/2 cup fish sauce
- [ ] 20ml fresh lemon juice (about 1/2 lemon)

- [ ] 1 whole cinnamon stick

#### Instructions
1. In a heavy-bottomed saucepan on a medium heat, combined the sugar and fish sauce. Swirl to melt the sugar. 
2. Melt it down and cook until it intensifies. Taste when it cools down a bit and add more fish sauce to taste.
3. Add the star anise, cinnamon stick, chilli cut in half lengthways, and shallot. Mix all together and cook until the sauce thickens, the sugar is completely melted, and it develops a deep amber colour. This should take about 10-15 minutes on a medium heat. I recommend sticking by the pot and keeping a watchful eye on the caramel as it can quickly go from transparent to burnt. 
4. Remove the aromatics, add the lemon juice, and set aside to cool. Use immediately or refrigerate.

5. in the meantime, thinly slice the ginger, peel and crush the garlic and thinly slice the shallot. add ginger, garlic, shallot, chili (if using fresh, split the chili before adding), star anise, cinnamon and black pepper to a bowl.
6. once the caramel is made, remove it from the heat and stir in the aromatics and fish sauce; it will bubble up so be careful. mix well to combine then let cool completely before sieving out the aromatics and storing in the fridge for at least one month; i’ve had caramels in the fridge that have lasted much longer.

#### Notes:
- This dish is about balance so taste as you go - but carefully as the caramel gets very hot.
