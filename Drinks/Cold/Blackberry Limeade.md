## Blackberry Limeade

### Ingredients
- [ ] 4 cups fresh blackberries, or frozen blackberries (thawed)
- [ ] 1 serving [[Cardamom Lime Sugar Syrup]]
- [ ] 1/2 cup lime juice
- [ ] 2 cups ginger ale or sparkling water
- [ ] Ice cubes
- [ ] Lime slices, for garnish
- [ ] Extra blackberries, for garnish
---
### Instructions
1. Lay a doubled piece of cheesecloth on a nonporous work area. (As the berries will stain a wide array of cutting surfaces and clothes, this may be best done outside or over newspaper and wearing an apron or smock.) 
2. Place the blackberries on top of the cheesecloth and gather into a bundle like a sack. Hold the sack of berries over a glass, stainless steel, plastic, or ceramic bowl. Twist the top of the sack to squeeze the juice from the berries into the receptacle. (This will yield about 1 cup very strong, tart, dark juice.) Refrigerate the juice until needed; discard the purple mash.
3. In a 1 litre pitcher, combine the blackberry juice, sugar syrup, and lime juice. Stir to combine and refrigerate until cold.
4. To serve, fill the pitcher with ice, stir in ginger ale or sparkling water, and serve with slices of lime.

#### Notes
- You can also briefly pulse the blackberries in a blender, and strain the juice that way. You just want to make sure that you aren’t blending the seeds too much that it makes it difficult to strain them out.
