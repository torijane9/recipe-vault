### Instructions
Berry Puree:
1. Place the mixed berries, caster sugar, lemon juice, and water into a small saucepan over a medium heat. 
2. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer, stirring occasionally. Cook for 5-10 minutes, until the berries have completely broken down and the sauce has thickened slightly. Use the back of a spoon to help mash the fruit as it cooks.
3. Taste and add a little more sugar if you feel it needs it (this will depend on the sweetness of your berries).
4. Remove from the heat. For a smoother texture, you can press the purée through a fine-mesh sieve to remove the seeds, but a more rustic, textured purée is also lovely.
5. Set the purée aside to cool completely. You can speed this up by placing it in the fridge.
Matcha Cream:
6. In a small bowl, sift the matcha powder (and icing sugar if using as a sweetener) together. This is a crucial step to prevent any lumps and ensure a silky-smooth cream.
7. Pour in the chilled cream.
8. Using a small whisk or an electric milk frother, whisk the mixture until it just starts to thicken. You are looking for a "ribbon" consistency – it should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon and fall in a slow, pourable stream. Be careful not to over-whip, as it will become too stiff to pour nicely.
Assemble the Drink:
9. Spoon about 2 tablespoons of the cooled berry purée into the bottom of a tall glass (a 450ml / 16 oz glass is ideal).
10. In a separate cup or jug, pour in your milk and stir in 1 more tablespoon of the berry purée until you have a lightly flavoured, pastel-coloured milk.
11. Fill your serving glass about three-quarters full with ice cubes, right on top of the purée layer.
12. Pour the berry-infused milk over the ice, leaving about 2-3 cm (about 1 inch) of space at the top of the glass.
13. Finally, take your thick matcha cream and pour it slowly and gently over the top. For the best visual effect, pour it over the back of a spoon held just above the milk's surface. 
14. Serve immediately with a long spoon or a straw, and admire the beautiful layers before stirring it all together to enjoy.
