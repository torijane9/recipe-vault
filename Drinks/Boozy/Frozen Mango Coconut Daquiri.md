### Instructions
1. In a blender, combine the frozen mango chunks, sugar, lime juice, coconut rum, and ice. Blend until smooth.
2. If it melts too much or is too soft, you can place back in the freezer, stirring every 30 minutes until desired slush is reached.
3. To make the topping, combine the coconut cream, caster sugar, and coconut rum, and whisk together until light and fluffy.
4. To serve, pour the mango slush between two glasses. Top each with a spoonful of the coconut cream mixture, and garnish with fresh mango and mint leaves.

#### Notes
- To get the thickest coconut cream, you want to buy the best quality can of coconut cream you can find. Tip the can upside down and chill in the fridge overnight. You should find that when you open the can, the cream at the top should be thick and spoonable, with the coconut water separated beneath.
