*   **Bulk Buying:** If you see good deals on non-perishables like rice, oats, or nuts, consider buying in bulk, especially with your ample freezer space for things like portioned cooked proteins.
*   **Seasonal Focus:** Keep an eye out for seasonal New Zealand produce at its best value and flavour!
