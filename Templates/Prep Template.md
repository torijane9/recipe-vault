**Step-by-Step Prep Guidance:**

1.  **Start with the longest cooks:** Get your pork belly roasting and rice cooking.
2.  **While they cook:** Prepare your sauces (Teriyaki, Satay, Vinaigrette).
3.  **Chopping Station:** While sauces cool, get all your vegetables prepped: shred coleslaw, chop herbs, prepare pickled veg. Store them as you go.
4.  **Protein Power Hour:** Once pork belly is out, cook your salmon, tofu mince, and roast the chermoula chicken/snapper.
5.  **Snack Attack:** Assemble chocolate-covered dates, blend the black bean dip, and bake muesli clusters/mix muesli.
6.  **Cool Down:** Ensure all cooked components are fully cooled to room temperature before storing them in the fridge to prevent condensation and bacterial growth.
