### Tuesday - Daily Assembly

**Breakfast (Lia): Lia's Anti-Inflammatory Muesli with Berries**
*   **Assembly:** Simply scoop a generous portion of your pre-mixed Lia's Anti-Inflammatory Muesli into a bowl. Top with a handful of fresh or frozen berries. Add a splash of your preferred milk (oat milk works beautifully here!).

**Breakfast (Tori): Nutty Muesli Clusters with Greek Yoghurt**
*   **Assembly:** Grab a handful of your pre-baked Nutty Muesli Clusters. Spoon Greek yoghurt into a bowl and sprinkle the clusters over the top. Quick and satisfying!

**Lunch (Both - Work): Vietnamese Salad Bowls**
*   **Assembly (Each Lunchbox):**
    1.  Place a base of cooked rice vermicelli noodles (if using, otherwise greens).
    2.  Add a generous portion of salad greens.
    3.  For Tori: Add a portion of pre-cooked Five-Spice Roast Pork Belly (sliced or shredded).
    4.  For Lia: Add a portion of pre-cooked Honey Lime Grilled Salmon (flaked) or Tofu Mince.
    5.  Top with a good amount of your prepped Vietnamese-style pickled vegetables, cucumber slices, and a sprinkle of your fresh coriander & mint mix.
    6.  **Dressing:** Pack Peanut Satay Sauce in a small separate container. Dress just before eating to keep everything fresh.

**Dinner (Shared): Teriyaki Salmon (Lia) / Teriyaki Chicken (Tori) with Coconut Rice & Steamed Pak Choy**
*   **Active Cooking Time:** ~15-20 minutes
*   **Instructions:**
    1.  **Rice:** Gently reheat your pre-cooked Toasted Coconut Rice in the microwave or a saucepan with a splash of water until warmed through.
    2.  **Proteins:**
        *   For Lia: Quickly pan-fry fresh salmon fillets (or use pre-cooked, flaked salmon and gently warm) until cooked through, then brush generously with Teriyaki Sauce in the last few minutes.
        *   For Tori: Quickly pan-fry chicken breast/thigh pieces until cooked through, then toss with Teriyaki Sauce.
    3.  **Pak Choy:** Steam or lightly stir-fry chopped pak choy for 3-5 minutes until tender-crisp.
    4.  **Serve:** Plate the warm coconut rice, protein (salmon for Lia, chicken for Tori), and steamed pak choy. Drizzle with any extra Teriyaki sauce.

**Flavour Variations / Adjustments:**

*   **Spice Level:** Lia can add a dash of sriracha or fresh chopped chilli to her Teriyaki sauce or salad dressing for an extra kick. Tori can keep hers mild.
*   **Vegetable Swaps:** If you have other quick-cooking veggies on hand, feel free to swap the pak choy for broccoli florets or green beans.
